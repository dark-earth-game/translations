L08D215A
 Arkhan! XXX
// Delia (panicked) perso10
L08D215B
 Over there... A Creature from the Darklands! XXX
// Delia (panicked) perso10
L08D215C
 What... What are we going to do? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L08D217A
 Don't worry, I'll take care of him... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L08D217B
 Don't move, whatever you do! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L08D218
 I'll figure something out... Stay here! XXX
// Kalhi perso33
L08D153
 Be careful Arkhan. Let's keep together. XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D92
 So, do you think the Sunseer is telling the truth? ...That the Black Shroud is really threatening us? XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D93A
 I don't know... XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D93B
 But after the attack on the Great Sunseer, we'd better keep a sharp look-out! XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D93C
 If those slimes come back, they'll get a surprise from me! XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D94A
 You said it! They'll pay for Jedar's death with their own blood! XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D94B
 And for what they did to Arkhan! XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D95
 What about the Great Sunseer? XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D96A
 With the declaration of martial law, she's gone into hiding. XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D96B
 Dhorkan has everything under control. XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D97A
 Yeah! They say Zed's down in the Lower City, chasing after the creatures that did it... XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D97B
 Okay, let's go. Better get back to our posts. XXX
// Guardian5 perso45 
L08D223
 The Sunseers say the Darkness got him! That he's no longer one of us! XXX
// Guardian6 perso46
L08D224A
 That doesn't mean he's plotting with the Konkalites! XXX
// Guardian6 perso46
L08D224B
 If Arkhan had done anything to hurt the Great Sunseer, she'd have said so. XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D225A
 How do you know? Dhorkan won't let anyone near the Great Sunseer. XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D225B
 A security measure. XXX
// Guardian6 perso46
L08D226
 No one's gonna make me believe Arkhan's a traitor. XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D227A
 Yeah... unless this disease has already eaten into his brain.... XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D227B
 Don't worry, if he tries any funny business, I'll get him! XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D316
 Did they find anything? XXX
// Guardian6 perso46
L08D317A
 Not yet.. except for a girl, a Scavenger. XXX
// Guardian6 perso46
L08D317B
 But I'd be surprised if she had anything to do with it....  XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D318A
 What do you know?! Some pretty strange things have been happening around here lately... XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D318B
 Anyway, the Scavengers are supposed to keep away from here. XXX
// Guardian6 perso46
L08D319
 They put her in the Stockade. If she knows anything, she'll break down and talk. XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D320
 Yeah. Well until then, keep your eyes peeled! XXX
// Guardian7 perso47
L08D143
 Ya hear that? Kabak says some Creatures from the Outer Darkness are down in the Lower City. XXX
// Guardian8 perso48
L08D144A
 Kabak's nothing but a crazy old coot! XXX
// Guardian8 perso48
L08D144B
 The Sun God is testing our faith. XXX
// Guardian8 perso48
L08D144C
 I'm not worried. The Sun God won't forsake us. XXX
// Guardian7 perso47
L08D145A
 I don't know... this business gives me the willies. XXX
// Guardian7 perso47
L08D145B
 What if the night never ended?! XXX
// Guardian8 perso48
L08D146A
 That's ridiculous! XXX
// Guardian8 perso48
L08D146B
 You're scared, that's why you're talking blasphemy! XXX
// Kalhi perso33
L08D220
 Come on, let's get outta here. Too many people have seen us already... XXX
// Kalhi perso33
L08D321
 Arkhan, don't go too far! XXX
// Kalhi perso33
L08D322
 What are you doing? XXX
// Kalhi perso33
L08D323
 Arkhan, stay here with me! XXX
// Kalhi2 (whispers) perso33
L08D209A
 Stay beside me and don't get too far away. XXX
// Kalhi2 (whispers) perso33
L08D209B
 There's a Guardian over there! XXX
// Kalhi (stunned) perso13
L08D335A
 You... you came back to get me? XXX
// Kalhi (stunned) perso13
L08D335B
 What made you do it? XXX
// Kalhi (close to tears) perso13
L08D335C
 It's the evil driving you mad! XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L08D157
 Arkhan! For the love of the Sun God, hurry up! XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L08D156
 If we hang around here any longer, someone's going to see us! XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L08D155
 Arkhan, let's get out of here! XXX
// Guardian10 perso50
L08D310
 Great Solaar! You're the creature! XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L08D158
 I'll wait here. Hurry! XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D303
 Watch out! XXX
// Guardian6 perso46
L08D304
 Watch out! XXX
// Guardian7 perso47
L08D305
 Watch out! XXX
// Guardian8 perso48
L08D147
 Okay, I'm going back up. I need more ammo! XXX
// Guardian7 perso47
L08D148
 Keep your eyes peeled! XXX
// Guardian7 (shouting in Arkhan's direction) perso47
L08D149
 Someone's trying to get past! XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D141
 Who goes there?! XXX
// Guardian6 (towards A.) perso46
L08D124
 Halt! Who goes there! XXX
// Guardian3 (after Arkhan's battle cry) perso43
L08D01
 What's come over you? XXX
// Guardian4 (after Arkhan's battle cry) perso44
L08D02
 I'll shut your trap for you! XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D270
 I'll bleed you like a stuck pig! XXX
// Guardian6 (attacked by A.) perso46
L08D140
 You'll never get me! XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D242
 Stop him! XXX
// Guardian3 (alarmed to see A. advance, addresses his partner as if to say "what do we do now"?) perso43
L08D243
 Garn?! XXX
// Guardian4 (taking out his weapons, frightened) perso44
L08D222
 Blasted hell, it's a demon from the Darklands! XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D241
 Garn, watch out! XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D324
 Hey, you over there! Halt! XXX
// Guardian10 perso50
L08D229
 Hello there, darling! XXX
// Kalhi perso33
L08D312A
 Hello to you, Guardian of Fire. XXX
// Kalhi perso33
L08D312B
 I'm escorting this prisoner to the Hospital. XXX
// Guardian10 perso50
L08D210
 Watch out, your prisoner's escaping! XXX
// Guardian10 perso50
L08D311
 Hey there! Where do you think you're going! XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L08D230
 You might at least have helped me get rid of that Guardian! XXX
// Guardian3 (attacked by Arkhan) perso43
L08D152
 Hey! Truce! XXX
// Guardian3 (A. puts away his weapon) perso43
L08D235
 That's more like it! XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L08D03
 Light be with you, Teskhan. XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D04
 And light be with you, Arkhan. XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L08D05
 What are you up to? XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D06A
 You haven't heard? The great Zed is getting ready for a new expedition into the Darklands. Captain Phedoria gave me orders to help him. XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D06B
 As you can see, lots of machines need repairs before he leaves. XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D06C
 And he's taking off at the next rising of the Sun God! XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L08D07
 You've got your work cut out for you! XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D08
 I can handle it, it's a pleasure to be able to help a man like Zed. You're lucky to be a friend of his... XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L08D17
 I have to go stand guard at the Great Temple. XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D18
 Yeah, I think Jedar's already over there... XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L08D19
 You know what's going on? XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D20A
 The Great Sunseer's meeting with the Scavengers. I think they've made some kind of discovery. XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D20B
 Don't worry, if Dhorkan's sending just you and Jedar, it shouldn't last very long.... XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L08D236
 I'm off, see ya later. XXX
// Guardian3 (1st time) perso43
L08D237
 Good luck Arkhan. XXX
// Guardian3 (2nd time, impatient) perso43
L08D238
 Yeah. Well, you'd better get going! XXX
// Arkhan1 O (mumbles) perso1
L08D10
 Mmmm... Teskhan. XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L08D11
 You still slaving away like a jerk? XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D12
 You kidding? Captain Phedoria asked me to help our great Zed get ready for his next expedition. XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L08D13A
 What a lousy life, being a Guardian of Fire! I should've followed in my father's footsteps and become a Sunseer! XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L08D13B
 All he has to do is mutter a sermon on the Sun God every now and then. XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L08D13C
 Aside from that, he spends all his time with his nose buried in dusty old documents no one understands.... XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D14A
 Don't talk like that. Rylsadhar's one of the wisest and most respected men in the Stallite. XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D14B
 He's an example for all the other Sunseers. XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L08D23A
 Well, I've got my own chores to do. I have to stand guard at the Hall of the Great Temple with Jedar. XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L08D23B
 That oughta be fun! It should really brighten up my day! XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D24
 Listen, you're lucky. In a situation like that, Dhorkan usually sends at least ten Guardians, and they have to stand in formation for hours. XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L08D239A
 Thanks. I can see you're not going to make me feel any better. XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L08D239B
 I just have to haul some coal and then... XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D240
 Have a good time! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D126
 Teskhan, don't be afraid. XXX
// Guardian3 (can't believe his eyes) perso43
L08D127
 Arkhan... You... I... What kind of curse has come over you? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso1
L08D100B
 The Creatures that attacked the Great Sunseer poisoned me. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso1
L08D100C
 And I have to find a way to cure this disease. XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D129A
 Don't worry. Dhorkan's blocked off all the entrances. XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D129B
 We'll catch all the intruders.  Zed went out in person to hunt them down. XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D129C
 You can be sure the creatures who dared attack Lory will pay with their lives! XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D129D
 The creatures who did... did that... to you. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D130A
 Hey, Teskhan, don't look at me like that! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D130B
 I'm still a Guardian of Fire, just like you. XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D131
 Listen..You oughta go see the Provost. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D132
 Hey, come on! Stop staring at me as if I were a Creature from the Darklands! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D133A
 My whole body is burning up with this poison! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D133B
 I'd better act fast. I have to find a cure. XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D134
 If you're sick, go see the Healers. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D135
 I don't think you can do anything else to help me... XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L08D25
 Hey, you wanna take a swig? XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D26
 You know Stohll doesn't agree with me! XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L08D27
 Sure? Sure you're not thirsty? XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D28
 Forget it. I'm not wild about that mushroom stuff. XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L08D29
 Hey, you thirsty? I've got a flask full of Stohll! XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D30
 Forget it, I said I don't like Stohll! XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L08D31
 What are  you a Guardian of Fire, or some wimp from the Lower City? Come on, take a drink! XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D32
 Knock it off, Arkhan. I don't want any of your mushroom juice! XXX
// Arkhan1 G perso1
L08D33
 Does this object mean anything to you? XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D34
 No. Forget it. XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D325
 Forget it! XXX
// Arkhan1 G perso1
L08D37
 Hey! Take it easy! XXX
// Guardian3 perso43
L08D232
 Just you wait, monster! XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D221
 Arkhan?... XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D151
 Hey... Easy does it! XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L08D39
 Light be with you, Garn. XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D40
 Light be with you, Arkhan. XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D41
 I'm on guard duty. Provost Dhorkan told me to stay here until further notice. XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L08D48
 I have to go over and guard the Great Temple. XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D49
 The Great Temple, huh? XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D50
 You can head out, the coast is clear! XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L08D51
 You know what's going on over there? XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D52A
 A special meeting with the Great Sunseer, something like that...XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D52B
 This isn't your lucky day. Usually they warn us in advance, and we all go over together. XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L08D42
 I hope we'll have some fun. XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D43
 Yeah, me too... XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L08D53
 Gee, Garn, this looks like really exciting work... XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D54
 You keep on laughing, Arkhan! You may never know, Dhorkan just might choose you to relieve me at nightfall.... XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L08D45
 Not having too much fun, are you? XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L08D55
 Not much going on, huh? I've got a boring assignment, too: I have to go over and guard the Hall in the Great Temple. XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L08D46
 Keep up the good work! With a little luck, Dhorkan will relieve you before you wear holes in your boots! XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D47A
 Yeah... Maybe I should tell him you're looking for something to do, and you could replace me! XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L08D56
 Well, don't let me keep you! I get the feeling you've still got a long way to go! XXX
// Guardian4 (irritated by Arkhan and beginning to get nasty) perso44
L08D57
 Let me give you a little piece of advice: get out of here, or you're gonna run into trouble... XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D98A
 It's all right Garn, it's me. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D98B
 I won't bite you! XXX
// Guardian4 (still not reassured) perso44
L08D99A
 No.. No... But you're... different. XXX
// Guardian4 (still unsure) perso44
L08D99B
 Don't take it personal, but how do I know if you're telling the truth? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso1
L08D100A
 Garn, I know what they told you, and what they want you to believe... but I haven't done anything wrong. XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D101A
 Yes... I believe you. XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D101B
 You're a friend of the great Zed's, so I trust you. XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D101C
 But Dhorkan's declared martial law. All intruders are being tracked down one by one. XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D101D
 You should go tell him what happened to you. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso1
L08D102A
 I'm still a Guardian of Fire. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso1
L08D102B
 I swear by the Sun God, it's true! XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D103A
 Okay. XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D103Z
 I believe you. XXX
// Arkhan2 O (threatening) perso1
L08D104
 Listen, Garn, if you wanna stay healthy, keep away from me! XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D105A
 What's come over you, Arkhan! XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D105B
 We're under martial law now. XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D105C
 I'll do my duty. I don't care about your threats! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso1
L08D106A
 Out of my way! I have to find an antidote for this poison before it wrecks me! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso1
L08D106B
 And if that means ripping apart a few idiots like you, then I'll do it! XXX
// Guardian4 (furious) perso44
L08D107A
 The Sunseer was right, the disease is driving you crazy. XXX
// Guardian4 (furious) perso44
L08D107B
 You're not a Guardian of Fire any more! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso1
L08D108
 Move aside, flea-bag! XXX
// Guardian4 (prepares to hit A.) perso44
L08D109
 You don't leave me any choice! XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L08D58
 You must get a little thirsty, marching up and down like that! XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D59
 No, thanks. Not on duty. XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L08D60
 Go ahead, do me a favor. XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D61A
 No, really. XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D61B
 But later tonight, once the lamp poles are  lit, I wouldn't mind a little nip. XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L08D62
 Go on, one little drink won't hurt! XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L08D63
 Blasted darkness, you're even more straight-laced than a Sunseer! Go on, take a drink! XXX
// Guardian4 (irritated) perso44
L08D64
 I told you, I'm not thirsty! XXX
// Arkhan1 G perso1
L08D65
 Does this object mean anything to you? XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D66
 No. Stop wasting my time. XXX
// Guardian4 perso44
L08D228
 What? No... It doesn't interest me. XXX
// Guardian4 (hit by A.) perso44
L08D69
 Arkhan! Don't get mad! XXX
// Guardian4 (hit by A.) perso44
L08D231
 It's true, you're completely inhuman! XXX
// Guardian5 (sees Arkhan2 1st time) perso45
L08D117A
 By the Rahal... Arkhan? XXX
// Guardian5 (awed) perso45
L08D117B
 Don't...... Don't come any closer! XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D116
 Don't get excited, I haven't done anything! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D244A
 Don't panic. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D244B
 I'm not looking for a fight. XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D245A
 Okay... Okay. XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D245B
 But you'd better beat it now... XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D245C
 Nobody wants you around here. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D246A
 Listen, my father Rylsadhar knows a cure for this disease. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D246B
 And believe me, I intend to cure it! XXX
// Guardian5 (openly hostile) perso45
L08D247A
 The Sunseers don't all think the way your father does! XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D247B
 Maybe there is no cure! XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D247C
 It would be better if you went into exile in the Darklands, before someone tries to wipe you out for good! XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D247D
 Think it over, before it's too late... XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D248A
 I can tell you don't trust me. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D248B
 We'll talk about it some other time, when I'm back to normal. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D249
 I'll prove you're wrong, buddy. Soon... you'll see. XXX
// Guardian5 (hostile) perso45
L08D250
 I've got my eye on you, Arkhan! XXX
// Guardian5 (threatening) perso45
L08D258
 We'll just see about that.... We'll see... XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D251A
 Blasted gloom! Yes, it's me! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D251B
 Don't just stand there with your tongue hanging out! XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D252A
 You... You'd better get out of here. XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D252B
 The Provost wouldn't like a creature like you sneaking around. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D253A
 Don't you believe it! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D253B
 The Provost gave me a special assignment! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D253C
 So go bite somebody else, flea-bag! XXX

 How do you think I got this beautiful mug? By risking my neck protecting the Great Sunseer, that's how! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D254B
 Where were you while I was risking my life, eh? XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D255A
 The Great Sunseer, huh?... She can't order anyone around any more. XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D255B
 From now on, the master of the Stallite is Dhorkan, and nobody else! XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D255C
 So just get that through your head! XXX
// Arkhan2 O (pretends to smell something) perso2
L08D256A
 What's that stink? XXX

L08D256B
 It's you! You're so scared, you're sweating vinegar, you scum.. XXX

L08D260B
 I'll bet all of this is your fault! XXX

 You brought the wrath of the Great Solaar down on us! XXX
// Arkhan2 L (softly) perso1
L08D261A
 Listen to me... Calm down... XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso1
L08D261B
 I came here to find an answer... XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D262A
 Liar! Heretic! XXX

L08D262B
 Your time is up! XXX

L08D263A
 You still here! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D263B
 I thought you'd all be out looking for somewhere to hide! XXX
// Guardian5 perso45
L08D264
 No! I'm not yellow! XXX
// Arkhan2 O (threatening) perso2
L08D265A
 Listen, wimp! Dhorkan hightailed it. Nobody's doing anything. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D265B
 The only man who still has a chance to save the Stallite is standing right in front of you! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D265C
 Now either you lay off me, or I rip your brains out! XXX

L08D273A
 I know they warned you about me. XXX

L08D273B
 But believe me, all I want is to find some way to get back to normal. XXX
// Guardian6 perso46
L08D274A
 Uh-huh... I won't stop you from going through. XXX
// Guardian6 perso46
L08D274B
 But you'd better keep your head screwed on. Plenty of other Guards would love to get their hands on you. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D275
 All I want is a cure for this disease. XXX
// Guardian6 perso46
L08D276
 Yeah... But if the Healers couldn't do anything... who else can cure you? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D277
 I'll find something, you'll see! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D278
 All right with you if I just keep on going? XXX

L08D279

 You don't wanna give me any trouble, do you? XXX
// Guardian6 perso46
L08D282A
 I don't want to fight with you, Arkhan. XXX
// Guardian6 perso46
L08D282B
 But if you provoke me, I'll have to draw my sword. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D283
 Don't ask for trouble, Guardian, or you won't live to regret it! XXX
// Guardian6 perso46
L08D284
 Arkhan, if you were still a Guardian of Fire, you'd understand I'm only doing my duty! XXX

L08D285
 Get out of my way, wimp! XXX
// Guardian6 perso46
L08D286
 That does it! XXX

L08D287A
 Don't let your fear of the dark get to you. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D287B
 We can still get out of this. XXX

// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D289
 Trust me, okay? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D290A
 Sunseer Thanandar is behind it all. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D290B
 He was contaminated, just like me. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D290C
 He let the poison destroy his mind, but I'm going to fight it to the bitter end! XXX
// Guardian6 perso46
L08D291
 We have to stop him! Where's he hiding? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D292A
 I don't know. But be careful, he's not human any more. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D292B
 I thought I'd killed him, but he wouldn't lie down . XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L08D292C
 Warn the other Guardians. If you don't kill him, he'll kill every last one of you! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2

 Keep your eyes open, okay? XXX
// Guardian6 perso46
L08D294
 Yeah. Don't worry. XXX

L08D295
 I get it. You're in the dark too, huh?  XXX
// Guardian6 perso46
L08D296A
 Shut your trap, Arkhan, if you know what's good for you! XXX
// Guardian6 perso46
L08D296B
 Maybe this is all your fault! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D297A
 I'll tell you what really happened! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D297B
 The man behind all this is Thanandar the Sunseer. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D297C
 He was contaminated, but nobody realized it! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D297D
 You were all too busy trying to get me! XXX
// Guardian6 perso46
L08D298
 Where is this Sunseer? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D299A
 If only I knew! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D299B
 But if he gets hold of you, you'd better put up the fight of your life! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D299C
 He's inhuman. He kills for the fun of it. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D299D
 And believe you me, you can never be sure he's really dead!  XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D300
 Stay here and keep your eyes peeled, got me? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L08D301
 Watch out for yourself, huh? XXX

// Arkhan1 G perso1
L08D83B
 This contraption won't fly unless there's really a lot of wind! XXX

L08D84
