 Go talk to Lory. I'll guard the entrance. XXX
// Phedoria (killing Arkhan after he killed Lory) perso26
L29D201
 Traitor ! You have condemned us all! XXX
// Lory (killing Arkhan after he killed Phedoria) perso15
L29D202
 You're mad! XXX
// Phedoria (A. draws a gun) perso26
L29D203
 Arkhan, put that away right now! XXX
// Phedoria (A. having put away his weapon) perso26
L29D204
 Our weapons are just for our enemies, okay? XXX
// Phedoria perso26
L29D52
 Do that again and I'll make you swallow your tongue! XXX
// Phedoria perso26
L29D53
 I warned you! XXX
// Phedoria (shooting at Arkhan who hit Lory) perso26
L29D47
 Arkhan! No! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L29D01
 Great Sunseer, what's going on? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L29D02
 Lory, what's going on? XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D03A
 Arkhan, the Stallite is in grave danger. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D03B
 By destroying the Well of Light, Thanandar has done more than just condemn us to darkness. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D03C
 He has opened the way to the creatures that roam the Darklands. Our walls no longer protect us! XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D03D
 Now that the Well of Light's energy is waning, nothing can keep them out of the city. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D03E
 If we don't act fast, we will all suffer the same fate that has befallen you. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L29D04A
 Zed and Rylsadhar died because of Thanandar! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L29D04B
 We must stop him! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L29D05
 No! I'm gonna avenge Zed and my father! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L29D06
 Me, Zed, my father... Have we all suffered in vain?! XXX
// Arkhan3 O (irritated) perso3
L29D07
 No! Revenge! XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D08A
 Listen, we still have a chance to save Sparta... and to cure you. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D08B
 Your father knew many secrets. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D08C
 For years he sought the... the source of the energy fuelling the Well of Light. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D08D
 You might find a clue in the secret retreat next to his room. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L29D09A
 First, I need to know how to get inside! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L29D09B
 I often tried when I was young. It can't be done! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L29D10A
 No one can get in there! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L29D10B
 The door can't be opened. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D11A
 Yes it can. There's a key made out of four crystals which, when assembled, looks like a Rahal. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D11B
 This morning, your father gave me the bow of that key. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D11C
 To assemble the whole key, we need to find the other three crystals as soon as possible. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D11D
 By studying the discoveries of your father, I hope to find another way to bring light to Sparta. XXX
// Lory (end) perso15
L29D11E
 I now give you the bow to the key, Arkhan. Guard it with your life. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L29D12A
 Lory. The hidden crypt... The Well of Light... My father's secrets... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L29D12B
 Tell me what's going on! Tell me what we're really looking for! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L29D13A
 Lory! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L29D13B
 Crypt... Hidden rooms... Well of Light... XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L29D13C
 What are we really looking for? XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D14A
 Listen, Arkhan, I don't have time to explain everything... XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D14B
 All you need to know is that beneath our feet is a... a place we call the Tomb. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D14C
 This place contains a source of incredible life-giving energy... XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D14D
 But the energy is... dormant. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D14E
 Our only chance is to find the energy source... and to awaken it from its sleep. XXX
// Lory (end) perso15
L29D14F
 If we find it before Thanandar does, it will destroy him and the evil consuming you! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L29D15
 But what has my father got to do with it? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L29D16
 And why my father? XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D17A
 Your father devoted part of his life to looking for a way into the Tomb. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D17B
 He believed that somewhere there must be a door leading into the Tomb. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D17C
 Up until now, his research in the crypt, the Stallite, and the Darklands has been fruitless. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D17D
 However, I know he was still trying. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D17E
 He took care to conceal his research from others, and he was right to do so. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D17F
 Somewhere deep within himself, your father must have foreseen Thanandar's treason. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D17G
 Rylsadhar was a seer, he possessed a unique energy that allowed him to see into the future. XXX
// Arkhan2 O (end) perso2
L29D18
 Yeah, but that energy didn't save him from death! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L29D19
 Tell me about Thanandar. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L29D20
 Tell me about Thanandar. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D21A
 He... he's a Sunseer, a healer. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D21B
 But the Darkness is in him. He is no longer human. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L29D22
It's sure! Normal beings don't come back from the dead! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L29D23
 Not when they've had their skulls cracked by me, they don't! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L29D24
 When I hit, no normal human being survives. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D25A
 He looks human, but is one no longer. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D25B
 The poison transforming his body is also depriving him of his reason and his humanity. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D25C
 He has vowed to destroy us, and he knows exactly how to do it. XXX
// Lory (end) perso15
L29D25D
 That is why we must hurry. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L29D26
 What are you going to do now? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L29D27
 And you? What are you going to do about it? XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D28A
 We must try to re-establish some kind of order. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D28B
 Dhorkan was blinded by his ambition, he wanted to turn events to his own advantage and gain mastery over Sparta. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D28C
 But the coward lost control of the situation. He has fled, the Great Solaar knows where! XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D28D
 Phedoria will try to muster the Guardians of Fire. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D28E
 We have to prepare for the worst. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D28F
 We can slow the arrival of the Black Shroud, but we can not stop it. XXX
// Lory (end) perso15
L29D28G
 The fate of Sparta is in your hands, Arkhan! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L29D29
 Do you have anything else to tell me? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L29D30
 That's all you can tell me, Sunseer? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L29D31
 That's all? XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D32
 That's all, Arkhan. Hurry up, there's no time to waste! XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D33
 Find Rylsadhar's key, that's the most important thing! XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D34
 Arkhan, stay calm, don't let the poison cloud your spirit! XXX
// Phedoria (ready to act) perso26
L29D35
 She's right, Arkhan. Don't force me to shoot. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D36
 Phedoria! Help me! XXX
// Arkhan2 L (showing the bow of the key) perso2
L29D37
 Who else might have a piece of this key? XXX
// Arkhan2 O (showing the bow of the key) perso2
L29D38
 Who can cough up the other pieces? XXX
// Arkhan3 G (showing the bow of the key) perso2
L29D39
 Who else has a piece of this key? XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D40A
 Rylsadhar must have given them to people he trusted. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D40B
 Me... Zed... and unfortunately maybe Dhorkan! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L29D41
 Nothing else about the key? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L29D42
 Any other ideas about the key? XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D43
 No, Arkhan, I can't think of anything else. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L29D44
 Great Sunseer... XXX
// Arkhan3 G (gravely) perso3
L29D45
 Lory... XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D46
 Arkhan, please, put your weapon away! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L29D66
 Ever seen this? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L29D67
 This object, Lory? XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D68A
 Arkhan, we're in a hurry. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D68B
 Go find your father's key. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L29D48
 Phedoria... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L29D49
 Phedoria... XXX
// Phedoria perso26
L29D50
 The Great Sunseer Lory will explain everything. XXX
// Phedoria perso26
L29D51
 Lory will tell you what you need to know. Go! XXX
// Phedoria perso26
L29D69
 We're counting on you, Arkhan. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D54A
 Arkhan! XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D54B
 There is someone your father might have given a piece of the key to: XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D54C
 Bandor, the Master Builder. XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D54D
 His quarters are in the builders' palace, in the main square. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L29D55
 What does he look like? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L29D56
 What's he look like? XXX
// Lory perso15
L29D57
 He's easy to recognize. He's a middle-aged man with dark skin and a metal leg! XXX
// Lory (A. going to leave) perso15
L29D74
 Arkhan, wait! We must talk! XXX
// Arkhan2 G (in front of clock) perso2
L29D58
 That reminds me, I'd better hurry! XXX
// Arkhan3 G (in front of clock) perso3
L29D59
 Every second counts! XXX
// Arkhan2 L (finding Lory dead) perso2
L29D60A
 Lory... You too... Thanandar again! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L29D60B
 He's pushing me hard! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L29D60C
 But don't worry, I'll make him pay! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L29D61
 There's nothing I can do for her. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L29D62
 She doesn't have anything. XXX
// Arkhan3 L (finding Lory dead) perso3
L29D63A
 Lory... No... XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L29D63B
 You'll get yours, Thanandar, if it costs me my life! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso2
L29D64
 Too late for her. XXX
// Arkhan3 O (searching Lory) perso3
L29D65
 Hmm... Nothing. XXX
// Arkhan2 L (seeing Phedoria dead) perso2
L29D70A
 Phedoria... no... XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L29D70B
They'll pay for this! XXX

L29D72
 She's dead... and, yes,  her weapon is gone. XXX
