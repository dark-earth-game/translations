 So, what...what do you want? XXX

 Whoa, whoa, whoa... Calm down... My name is Arkhan, I'm a friend of the Scavengers. XXX

// Arkhan2 L perso2
L16D108
 Armal Sadak? XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D109A
 Sure! He's the chief Scavenger in the Lower City. Everyone around here owes him something. XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D109B
 If there's one person who can help you, it's him! I don't know if he'd want to though... XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L16D110
 Where can I find him? XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D111
 It's not that easy... I can't just take you to see him. I need proof that you're on the level with me. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L16D112
 I know Armal Sadak. but I don't know if he can help me.  XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D113
 If Armal Sadak can't help you, I don't see what I can do. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L16D114
 What do you want me to do? XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D115A
 Bring me a present, something beautiful, something shiny...  XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D115B
 Then I'll see what I can get Armal Sadak to do for you... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L16D116
 You've got nothing else to say? XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D117
 No, I don't think so. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L16D118
 Shut up! Stop bawling!  XXX
// Delia (fearful)perso10
L16D119
 No! Please, don't hurt me! XXX
// Arkhan2 O (menacingly) perso2
L16D120A
 Enough, slut! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L16D120B
Listen, If you don't cooperate with me, I'm gonna teach you a VERY special little "dance" and you won't soon forget it, believe me! XXX
// Delia (becoming frightened) perso10
L16D121
 No! Maor, help! XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D886A
 You came to barter? XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D886B
I'm not interested, my gentleman friends give me everything I want... XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D887
 I told you I don't barter! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L16D66
 You're gonna help me and your gonna help me now, or I'm going to give you a little face-lift! XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D67
 No, don't hit me! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L16D68
 I have no gift to offer you, but I really need your help! XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D69
 Sorry, I just can't take you to see Armal Sadak like that... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L16D70
 Maybe I have what you're looking for. How about that? XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D71
 No. That doesn't interest me... XXX
// Delia (A. gives her a CD)perso10
L16D72
 A light mirror from Before! Yes, it's wonderful! XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D74A
 You'll find Armal Sadak not far from here, in a building that looks like a boat. XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D74B
 When you see him, say this phrase : XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D74C
 "Mankind is but a pawn the hand of Destiny moves sometimes into the Dark, and sometimes into the Light." XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D75
 It's a password. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L16D76
 That's all? XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D77
 That's all you need to talk to him. But if you really want him to help you, you'll need to beat him at Yong. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L16D78
 What's Yong, a game? XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D79A
 It's Armal Sadak's favorite game. He plays it all the time. XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D79B
 He says that life is like playing Yong, or something like that. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L16D80
 How can I beat him? XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D81A
 I don't really know...  XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D81B
 It's played on a board with pawns of darkness and pawns of light. XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D82
 And Armal always says that to win, you've got to place the pawns at the corners of the board.   XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L16D83
 Can't you tell me anything else? XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D84
 No, I've told you everything I know.  XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D85
 Now, you must go... XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D885A
 You've already given me a present, that's enough. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L16D400
 Don't be afraid! I won't hurt you. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L16D401
 Shut up, slut, or I'll give you something to yap about! XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D404A
 Monster! You'll pay for what you've done to Maor. XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D404B
 If you touch me, Armal will dig out your heart with his fingernails! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L16D405
 I'm not going to kill anyone, I need help. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L16D406
 All I want is some help! XXX
// Delia perso10
L16D408
 Get out of here! I've got nothing to say! XXX
// Delia (hit by Arkhan) perso10
L16D403
 Stop, you filthy beast! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L16D300A
 Hi... Maor, right? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L16D300B
 Nice show... XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D301
 Hmm... What do you want? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L16D302A
 Oooh ! Tasty little dancer you've got there. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L16D302B
 How do you feel about sharing her? XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D303A
 Forget it, man. Delia has lots of gentlemen friends as it is. XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D303B
 And in any case, you're not her type! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L16D304A
 I'm Arkhan, friend of the Scavengers. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L16D304B
 I've got some problems with the Guardians of Fire... and could use a little help. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L16D306A
 My name's Arkhan. I've got the Guardians of Fire on my butt and poison rotting me out... XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L16D306B
 And, if you want to know the truth, I'm trying to solve the whole mess down here, right in the middle of all the tattooed half-wits in this rat hole! XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D305
 I see... But you won't have any luck here. XXX
// Maor (gruffly but generously)perso17
L16D307A
 Daaaa..., there's a flask of Stohll on the table.  XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D307B
 Help yourself, it's on the house. XXX
// Maor (gruffly but generously)perso17
L16D308A
 And keep the flask, it's yours. XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D308B
 That's all I can do for you. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L16D309
 If you can't help me, who can? XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D310A
 Hmm... I suppose you're not going to turn yourself in to the Guardians of Fire... XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D310B
 If you've got nothing to lose, you could always go see Armal Sadak. XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D310C
 But whatever you do, don't mess with the Konkalites. That's just asking for trouble! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L16D311A
 I was wondering-do you ever smile? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L16D311B
 Or do you spend all your time trying to look tough? XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D312A
 I only smile at pretty girls, okay? XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D312B
 Get going, I'm a busy man... XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L16D313
 Couldn't you tell me just a little bit more? XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D314
 Sorry, I'm fresh out of advice. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L16D315
 Are you sure you don't have anything else to tell me? XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D316A
 I'm sure...  XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D316B
 Look, if it's small talk you're after, go see Delia. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L16D317A
 Tough guy, huh! You know what I think? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L16D317B
 I think you're shaking like a leaf. I think you've got your legs crossed to keep your knees from knocking! XXX
// Maor (angrily) perso17
L16D318A
 Okay, amigo! What you need is your face rearranged . XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D318B
 Come over here, I'm going to do you a favor! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L16D320

L16D322
 Relax. I'm looking for... some help. XXX
// Maor (impressed)perso17
L16D323
 Sorry, amigo. Nothin' I do for you. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L16D324
 Who can I go see... a healer perhaps. XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D325A
 Uh... I'm just a Scavenger, healing is way out of my league... XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D326A
 But there's a flask of Stohll, there, on the table. XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D326B
 If you want it, take it.  XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D327A
 Keep the Stohll, it's yours. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso2
L16D328
 Are you sure you can't help me? XXX
// Maor (uneasy) perso17
L16D329
 I'd like to, but I don't know what to tell you... XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso2
L16D330
 You really have nothing for me? XXX
// Maor (uneasy)perso17
L16D331
 No, sorry... XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L16D332
 You! You're going to help me! XXX
// Maor (impressed) perso17
L16D333A
 I don't know who you are or what you want! XXX
// Maor (impressed) perso17
L16D333B
 But I'm warning you: I've got a weapon and I know how to use it! XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L16D334
 You little scumbag, I'm going to slaughter you! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L16D335
 Have some Stohll? XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D336
 Keep it for yourself, I've got all I need! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L16D337
 Stohll? XXX
// Maor (impressed)perso17
L16D338
 No... No... Just drink  in my honor. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L16D339
 You want a flask? XXX

L16D340
 No, amigo, that's enough for me. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L16D341
 You want some? XXX
// Maor (impressed)perso17
L16D342
 No... Thanks. XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D343
 No, I don't want any. XXX
// Maor (impressed)perso17
L16D346
 No, thanks. Keep it for yourself. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L16D904
Hmm... roast bird, very tempting. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso2
L16D905
 A bird... and well roasted! XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D04
 Hey, get out of there! XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D07A
 Hey, the bar is my turf! XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D07B
 And I want you out of it, understand? XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D08
 I warned you! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L16D118A
 A little music box. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L16D118B

// Arkhan3 G perso3
L16D119A
 A music box. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L16D119B
 Like the one Danrys made for me so long ago. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L16D900
 With spikes like those, no one would jump on stage and kiss the dancer! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
