// Phedoria (coolly fires her weapon) perso26
L01D45B
 You don't leave me much choice! XXX
// Kalhi (brokenhearted over Arkhan's death) perso12
L01D44

// Kabak (attacking) perso87

 Hey, Kabak! XXX
// Kabak (grumbling) perso87
L01D67
 Light b'with you, Arkhan... XXX

L01D60B
 Don't go! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L01D61A
 Don't be scared! XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L01D61B
 (growls aggressively) XXX
// Kabak (stunned at the sight of Arkhan) perso87
L01D30A
 Arkhan! Is that really you? XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D30B
 Holy Sun God, they really messed you up! XXX
// Kabak (seeing Arkhan2/3 again) perso87

// Kabak (Arkhan comes back after having fled the battle) perso87
L01D87
 There you are, you dirty rat! XXX
// Kabak (Arkhan puts the weapons away) perso87
L01D80
 That's better.  XXX
// Kabak (hit by Arkhan1) perso87
L01D137
 Try that again, and you'll be sorry! XXX
// Kabak (hit by Arkhan2/3) perso87
L01D138A
 You're no beauty, but old Kabak has seen some real eyesores in his time!  XXX
// Guardian23 (shocked at the sight of Arkhan) perso88
L01D121
 Kabak! By all that's dark!  It's one of those creatures! XXX
// Kabak (to Lars, wounded Guardian) perso87
L01D31A
 Don't panic, Lars! XXX
// Kabak (reassuring) perso87
L01D31B
 Lars, calm down! That "thing" you're talking about is Arkhan.  XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D31C
 This morning, he was still a Guardian of Fire, just like you and me. He's not our enemy. XXX
// Guardian23 (unconvinced that Arkhan is harmless) perso88
L01D122
 Okay, but whatever you are, don't come any closer. Arkhan! XXX
// Guardian23 (unconvinced that Arkhan is harmless) perso88
L01D123
 Be careful Arkhan! I can still put up a good fight! XXX
// Guardian23 (shocked at the sight of Arkhan) perso88
L01D124
 Kabak! Are you talking to that thing?... His very presence is sickening! XXX
// Kabak (suspicious) perso87
L01D171
 He won't do anything to you... Will you Arkhan? XXX
// Guardian23 (doesn't want to look at Arkhan) perso88
L01D94
 Kabak, call your creature back! XXX
// Guardian23 (doesn't want to look at Arkhan) perso88
L01D95
 Kabak, I don't like this! His eyes are brimming with gloom! XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D96
 That's enough, Lars!  He's a victim, like you. XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D172
 He's not crazy! He won't harm us! XXX
// Guardian23 (attacking Arkhan) perso88
L01D127
 Kill the demon! XXX
// Arkhan1 L (beside a bed) perso1
L01D21A
 I'm so tired... But I have to go. XXX
// Kalhi (a little impatient) perso12
L01D29A
 Arkhan, hurry up, Zed's waiting for you...  XXX
// Kalhi (a little impatient) perso12
L01D29B
 Arkhan, now that you've got your uniform on, go find Zed... XXX
// Arkhan2 G (beside a bed) perso2
L01D21B
 This is no time for sleeping! XXX
// Arkhan3 G (beside a bed) perso3
L01D21C
 This is no time... XXX
// Arkhan1 O (beside a bed) perso1
L01D21D
 By all that's dark! I'm sick of this, I never get any sleep. XXX
// Kalhi (impatient) perso12
L01D29C
 Arkhan, quit complaining! XXX
// Arkhan0 L perso0
L01D119
 Here's my Guardian of Fire uniform. XXX
// Arkhan0 O (mumbling) perso0
L01D120
 It's my Guardian's uniform. XXX
// Kalhi (Arkhan goes out dressed in his underwear) perso12
L01D32
 Arkhan, you're not going out dressed like that!? XXX
// Arkhan1 G (ironical) perso0
L01D33
 No, I might have a few problems if I walk around like this! XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L01D34A
 Kalhi, be careful, don't let anyone see you leaving.  XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L01D34B
 I don't want Provost Dhorkan to see you. You know how strict he is about letting outsiders into the Guardians of Fire barracks... XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D36
 Don't worry Arkhan, I'll leave just as quietly as I came. XXX
// Arkhan1 O (scolding) perso1
L01D35A
 Hey, Kalhi, get a move on! XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L01D35B
 You know perfectly well Scavengers aren't allowed inside the Guardians of Fire barracks.  XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L01D35C
 If Provost Dhorkan finds you here, I'll be put on latrine duty!  XXX
// Kalhi (upset) perso12
L01D37
 Listen, if you don't want me to come around anymore, you can just say so!  XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D41
 Hey there, calm down! You're supposed to train with Zed, not with me! XXX
// Arkhan1 G (softly) perso0
L01D02
 Kalhi, you asleep? XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso0
L01D04A
 I didn't want to wake you. But the first rays from the Sun God are already filtering through.... XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D05A
 Don't worry, I was only dozing. XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso0
L01D04B
 You know, I had a funny dream. I saw the Great Cataclysm and our ancestors-the Wanderers who built our city... XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D05B
 You dreamed about the founders of Sparta? XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D05C
 That's the kind of dream Rylsadhar would like.  XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D05D
 Your Sunseer father really gets a kick out of History! XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso0
L01D06A
 Believe it or not, you were in my dream too! Along with my father, Zed, and the Great Sunseer Lory...  XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso0
L01D06B
 Even our friend Danrys, the old Scavenger was there.  XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D07
 Do you think the Sun God might have inspired your dream? XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso0
L01D08A
 I hope not! XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso0
L01D08B
 Listen, if the Sun God really wanted to do me a favor, he'd rise a little later, so you and I could sleep in peace!  XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D09A
 Arkhan! If your father heard you say that...! XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D09Z
 If you don't show more respect, you'll end up exiled in the Darklands! XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso0
L01D10
 It's time to leave, all right? If anyone catches us here together, we'll both be in big trouble. XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D11
 I know, you're right.  There's no sense playing with fire. XXX
// Arkhan1 O (in a bad mood) perso0
L01D13A
 Stop it Kalhi, I'm not in the mood! XXX
// Kalhi (upset) perso12
L01D14
Okay, fine, if you feel like that, then I'll just shut up... XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso0
L01D13B
 I had a nightmare... I dreamed about our city's past... XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso0
L01D15
 I'm sick of this! I'm not a God! Why should I have to get up when the Great Lightgiver does?! XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso0
L01D16
 Be a worthy Guardian of Fire. Serve the Sun God. That's all the Sunseers ever talk about! XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D09B
 Let me tell you something, the life of Scavengers like me and old Danrys isn't exactly a bed of feathers either! XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L01D18
 I want to lie down next to you again... XXX
// Kalhi (irritated) perso12
L01D19
 Arkhan, no! It was dangerous enough just to spend the night here together!  We can't get caught... XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso0
L01D46A
 Okay, Zed's calling, I have to go. XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D20A
Hmmm. Don't forget to give him a kiss from me. Without his help, we'd never have been able to see each other last night... XXX
// Arkhan1 L (feigning disgust) perso0
L01D46B
 He's not my type! XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso0
L01D46C
 I can't understand why all women are so crazy about Zed... XXX
// Kalhi (amused) perso12
L01D20B
 You're a little mixed up, aren't you!  You're the one I'm in love with! XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso0
L01D47
 Zed... even Zed has a grudge against me! XXX
// Kalhi (exasperated) perso12
L01D26A
You're not going to start criticizing Zed, are you! He's your friend, and he's the Stallite's biggest hero!  XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D26B
 And without his help, we'd never have been able to see each other last night... XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso0
L01D88A
 It's time to go, I'm off. XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D89A
 Light go with you, darling. XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso0
L01D88B
 (sigh) We're off... XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D89B
 Come on, cheer up! XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L01D24A
 I saw Zed. He was all set to start training.  I think he's itching for action. XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D25A
 But he just got back from his trip in the Darklands.  He never rests!  XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L01D83
 I saw Zed. He's ready for action...  and too busy to notice me!  Some friendship! XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D84A
 Arkhan, don't be so ungrateful! It's true Zed spends too much time in the Darklands.  That's enough to make anyone a little grim.  But I've never heard him speak a harsh word to you.  XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D25B
 You should try to reason with him. Someday he'll go out into the Darklands and never come back. He should stay here and live with us.  He's one of our greatest Guardians of Fire! XXX
// Arkhan1 G perso1
L01D24B
 He says life in the Stallite bores him. You should see the look he gets in his eyes when he's ready to leave. I don't think anyone or anything could make him change his mind! XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D25C
 May the Sun God always watch over him! XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L01D27A
 I have to go. Light go with you, Kalhi. XXX
// Kalhi perso12
L01D28
 Light go with you, sweetheart. XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L01D85A
 That's enough. I'm going. XXX
// Arkhan1 O (grumbling) perso1
L01D85B
 Yeah... I'll go with ya.. XXX
// Kalhi (uneasy) perso12
L01D42
 Stop it, Arkhan! You're scaring me! XXX
// Kalhi (terrified)  perso12
L01D43A
 Arkhan, Holy Sun God! Please don't hurt me! XXX
// Arkhan0 G (growling at Kalhi) perso0
L01D98
 Rotten slut, I'll teach you a lesson! XXX
// Kalhi (crying out in fear) perso12
L01D43B
 No! No! Help me! Someone help me! XXX
// Arkhan0 G (splashing water on his face) perso0
L01D23A
 Ah... That feels good! XXX
// Arkhan2 G (splashing water on his face) perso2
L01D23B
 Ah... That feels good !XXX
// Arkhan3 G (splashing water on his face) perso3
L01D23C
 Ah...yes that's good. XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L01D48
 Light be with you, Kabak! XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D49A
 Believe me son, the Father of Light has been kind to us today! XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D49B
 I just ran across a fiery-eyed young beauty... good enough to eat! XXX
// Arkhan1 L (embarrassed) perso1
L01D50
 Hmmm... Oh yeah...? XXX
// Kabak (dreamy) perso87
L01D51A
 A real dish! For a minute there, I considered resting my old bones on her soft curves. XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D51B
 But she was a lively young lady.  XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D51C
 She ran off-whee-like a fart on an oil slick! XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L01D52
 Kabak! Still trying to warm up your old bones, I see. XXX
// Arkhan1 O (sarcastic) perso1
L01D53
 Sure. Overdid it with the mushroom Stohll last night, didn't you? XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D54A
 No... I'm telling you, I saw her with my own eyes! XXX
// Kabak (grumbling) perso87
L01D54B
 Huh! No one ever believes me.. XXX
// Arkhan1 G perso1
L01D128
 See anything else besides your ghost of a girl? XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D129A
 There's some kind of unscheduled assembly going on over at the Temple of the Sun God. Looks to me like the Great Sunseer is meeting with the Scavengers. XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D129B
 It couldn't be all that important, if Dhorkan is only sending over two of us.  XXX
// Arkhan1 G perso1
L01D130
 What's this about a special meeting? XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D131A
I think some guys from the Lower City have discovered something, and they want to show it to the Great  Sunseer. XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D131B
 Or something like that... XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L01D132
 Nothing else? XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D133
 No, I think that's it... XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L01D134
 You're never sure about anything! XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D135
 Well, if you don't like it, why don't you go talk to the Provost?! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L01D55A
 Kabak... I'm looking for the medicine that will cure me.  XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L01D55B
 I've heard about a crypt, a secret place somewhere in the Stallite.  XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L01D55C
 You've been here longer than almost anyone, surely you must know something about it? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L01D56A
Listen  Kabak! I've got to find a cure for this filth that's eating away my body!  XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L01D56B
 There's supposed to be some kind of crypt, a secret place where I could be cured.  XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L01D56C
 You've been around longer than anyone.  If you know anything, you better tell me!  XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L01D57A
 Kabak, I  must find this place where I can be cured. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L01D57B
 A secret crypt. Do you know the place? XXX
// Kabak (thinking) perso87
L01D59A
 A secret crypt... uh... no, I don't know anything about it.  XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D59B
 Some people say the whole Stallite is filled with underground vaults and grottos, but I say it's nothing but talk.  XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D59C
 You want my opinion, son, you should go see the Sunseer healers.  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L01D62A
 The healers can't do anything for me... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L01D62B
 The healers can't do anything... XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D63A
 Then there's only one thing left to do: pray to the Sun God and ask him to drive out the darkness invading your body.  XXX
// Kabak (hesitating) perso87
L01D63B
 Or else... XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D63C
 Some people say there's a woman out in the Darklands who can heal any disease, no matter how bad.  XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D63D
 Those are nothing but kids' stories...  XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D63E
 And anyway, now that they've declared martial law, no one can get out of the city! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L01D64A
 You really don't know anything else about it? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L01D64B
Nothing else? XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D65A
 No, my boy. I don't know anything, I swear it. XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D65B
 But there's one thing I do know... you'd better watch out. XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D65C
 Lots of those Guardians of Fire out there would love to put you six feet under!  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L01D173A
 The Sunseer Thanandar tricked me.  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L01D173B
The evil darkness is still there, running through my veins.  XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L01D174
Look at me.  I have to find a cure quick, no matter where it is, no matter what it is! XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D175A
 Don't give up hope! XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D175B
 There must be a solution out there somewhere. XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D175C
 The Sun God will not forsake you! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L01D68
 Kabak. You're safe and sound... What's going on? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L01D69
 Kabak! You still hanging around here? You got any idea what's going on? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L01D70
 Kabak! What's going on?  XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L01D71
 Tell me..What's going on? XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D72A
 It's absolute chaos. There's a riot in the Lower City. They say many have died. XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D72B
 Some people even say that creatures from the Darklands have gotten into the Stallite.  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L01D73
 Who's winning the battle? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L01D74
 Who is winning? XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D75A
 We have no idea.  Dhorkan's disappeared... or else he's dead.  People are dying like flies, on both sides.  XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D75B
 The Sun God has forsaken us, Arkhan. It's over! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L01D76
 Don't give up, Kabak! They haven't finished us off yet! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L01D77
 Come on, suck it up! We're going to get out of this alive! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso2
L01D78
 Take heart, Kabak! XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso2
L01D79
 Coward! XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D146
 You'd better get out of here, Arkhan! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L01D108
 Kabak, what's the situation? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L01D109
 How are things going? XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D110A
 Look at that poor clod over there... he's the only one still alive from his group. XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D110B
 Our enemies down below aren't normal human beings. There's something else...  XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D110C
 The... creatures from the Darklands. It's true, they're amongst us! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L01D111
 If Zed were here,  he'd know what to do! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L01D112
 If only Zed were here! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L01D200
 What are you doing? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L01D201
 What are you doing? XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D202A
 What am I doing? I'm doing what the Healers wouldn't do! XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D202B
 I'm preparing a potion for everyone who can still be cured...  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L01D203
 Will your potion cure me? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L01D204
 Can I have some of your potion? XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D205
 No, Arkhan, I'm sorry.  I don't have enough, and I don't think it would do any good in your case.... XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L01D206
 Give me some, Kabak. Your potion will help me, I'm sure. XXX
// Arkhan2 0 perso2  
L01D207
 I want that potion! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L01D208
 Please. I need your potion! XXX
// Arkhan3 0 perso3
L01D209
Give me that potion! XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D210
 I said no! I have to treat my men! XXX
// Arkhan1 G (disclosing the object in his hand) perso1
L01D105
 Does this object mean anything to you? XXX
// Arkhan2 G (disclosing the object in his hand) perso2
L01D106
 Do you know anything about this object? XXX
// Arkhan3 G (disclosing the object in his hand) perso3
L01D107
 Look at this. Do you know what it is? XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D92A
 No... I don't see what you're driving at... XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D92B
 That? No, it doesn't mean anything special to me... XXX
// Kabak perso87
L01D92C
