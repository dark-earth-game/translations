L18D117
 Jianu! Block the door! XXX
// Armal Sadak (preparing to fight) perso6

 Let's get serious! XXX

L18D160
 Chief! Fart-Face is playing rough! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D161

// Malrot2 (menacingly) perso62
L18D136
 Hear that, Tough Guy? XXX
// Malrot2 (alerting Armal Sadak) perso62
L18D137
 Chief! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D120A
 You're outta luck, my friend. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D120B
 If you want the info, you'll have to play another round. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D121
 You know my price: a weapon! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D132
 Can't win'em all! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D122A
 Congratulations! You win! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D250
 So, are you going to help me? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D278
 Help me... now... XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D122B
 Okay, I'll tell you a little more. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D122C
 In the Lower City, the Scavengers and the Providers work together. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D122D
 We get along just fine. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D122E
 Lory the Great Sunseer wasn't born yesterday. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D122F
 She leaves us alone, we leave her alone. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D122G
 As long as the Guardians of Fire don't get in our way... XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D122H
 The real pain is the Konkalites. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D122I
 Scumbags, you know what I mean? All they care about is seeing blood flow. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D122J
 They're the ones that attacked the Great Sunseer! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D122K
 But they're not smart enough to have figured it out for themselves. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D122L
 Someone else up there is behind it... XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D122M
 I'm sure it's not Dhorkan. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D122N
 But I'd give a lot to know who it is! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D123A
 Great! You're a good player. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D123B
 So, you want to know what I know about Provost Dhorkan? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D123C
 He's all hugs and kisses with the Sunseers and the Guardians of Fire, but he's a rotten traitor. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D123D
 He wants to get rid of the Sunseers so he can rule the Stallite all by himself. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D123E
 And to do it, that jerk has signed a pact with Sordos. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D123F
 Dhorkan must think he can make the Konkalites do anything he wants and then dump them when he doesn't need them anymore. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D251A
 Why not? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D251B
 You said Konkalites are morons, right? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D252
 Yeah, if... Konkalites are... as stupid as  you say. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D253A
 Right. But I know someone else is behind Sordos. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D253B
 Someone who ordered the attack on Lory. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D253C
 And by the time Dhorkan figures it out, it'll be too late! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D279A
 I've got good news for you,  Sadak. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D279B
 You can stop worrying about Sordos. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D279C
 I fixed him... But good. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D280A
 Good news for you! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D280B
 I fixed Sordos... but good. XXX
// Armal Sadak (surprised) perso6
L18D281A
 Well I'll be! What did you say? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D281B
 You killed Sordos? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D281C
 Ah! Arkhan, my dear friend! If what you say is true, may the Great Solaar shower blessings on you! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D281D
 But if I find out you lied, you'll hear from me! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D282
 I'm not lying, believe me. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D283
 I don't lie. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D254A
 Hey, you're real good. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D254B
 Here. Here's some ammo for the thunderbolts from Before. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D254C
 Don't waste it, it's scarce! XXX
// Malrot2 perso62
L18D175
 If you want some Stohll, grab a gourd. XXX
// Malrot6 (very grateful) perso66
L18D195A
 Thank you, brother! XXX
// Malrot6 (enraged) perso66
L18D195B
 I'm going to show them how it feels when a Scavenger turns the light on their maggot nest! XXX
// Armal Sadak (shouting) perso6
L18D196
 Don't forget to watch your ass! XXX
// Armal Sadak (amused, to Arkhan) perso6
L18D197
 I wouldn't like to be in their shoes when he finds them! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D08
 Wanna play a game? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D09
 Play a game? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D07A
 Let me tell you something, whoever or whatever you are. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D07B
 I only play with people who're my guests. And I've  never seen you in my life before! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D07C
 So if you know what's good for you, don't hang around here, okay? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D119
 I make the first move. Age before beauty! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D202
 Listen, first tell me exactly what you're looking for. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D203A
 Maybe Later. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D203B
 Right now you'd better save what's left of your own skin. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D204
 How about a round? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D205
 A game? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D206
 Sure, if you've got a good weapon to bet on the game. XXX
// Malrot2 perso62
L18D159
 No, keep your troubles to yourself. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L18D139A
 Simmer down! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L18D139B
 I'm a friend of the Scavengers. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L18D140
 Cool it. XXX
// Malrot2 perso62
L18D141A
 Hey, listen. I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you. XXX
// Malrot2 perso62
L18D141B
 Got it? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L18D142
 Who's in charge here? XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L18D143
 Who's in charge? XXX
// Malrot2 perso62
L18D144
 No one! So take your walkin' freak show somewhere else ! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L18D145
 Who're you? XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L18D146
 You... who? XXX
// Malrot2 perso62
L18D147
 None of your business. Get outta here! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D23A
 I've got a message for you: XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D23B
"Mankind is but a pawn that the hand of Destiny moves sometimes into the Darkness, and sometimes into the Light". XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D24A
 Me... message for you: XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D24B
"Mankind... but pawn... the hand of Destiny moves... sometimes into Darkness... sometimes into Light". XXX
// Malrot2 perso62
L18D274A
 Hey, since when do animals like you write poetry? Hah, hah, hah! XXX
// Malrot2 perso62
L18D274B
 Go on, get your creepy ass outta here, pronto, before I kick it into the Darkness for good! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L18D148
 Your chief's quite a guy! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L18D149
 Chief... quite a guy! XXX
// Malrot2 perso62
L18D150
 Yeah. But don't rub him the wrong way! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L18D154
 So you're Armal Sadak's bootlicker, eh? XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L18D155
 Armal Sadak's yes-man? XXX
// Malrot2 perso62
L18D156
 Whatever you say. I couldn't care less... XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L18D151
 Who's the snoring flea bag over there? XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L18D152
 Who's the boozer over there? XXX
// Malrot2 perso62
L18D153A
 Hey listen around here, we like drinkin' and eatin'. XXX
// Malrot2 perso62
L18D153B
 And when we get tired, the waves rock us to sleep... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D184
 Want a swig of Stohll? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D185
 Drink? XXX
// Malrot2 perso62
L18D186
 No, that mug of yours doesn't turn me on! XXX
// Malrot2 perso62
L18D187
 A little Stohll? Don't mind if I do. XXX
// Malrot2 (burping) perso62
L18D188
 ... Thanks. XXX
// Malrot2 (after drinking) perso62
L18D189
 Aaahhh... hey wouldn't mind another! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L18D12
 What's your game? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L18D13
 Wha's yer game? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L18D15
 What kind of kiddie game is this? XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L18D16
 Some kiddie game? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D14A
 This is the game of Yong. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D14B
 You're not from around here, are you. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L18D18
 How do you play this game of yours? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L18D19
You show.... How play the game? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L18D21
 I can beat you with my eyes closed! XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L18D22
 I'll beat you, eyes closed! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D20A
 Bubbling black plague. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D20B
 I don't have any time to waste on chitchat... XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D20C
 (Sigh) XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D25
 I see you were sent by a mutual friend. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D255
 Yes, I spoke... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D256
 Yes, it's... XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D25A
 Stop. I don't need to hear any more. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D25B
 You're welcome here, don't give it another thought. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D25C
 And don't ask any questions... XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D257
 I already told you, I don't drink. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D258
 No offense intended, but I never drink. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D28A
 I'm not here to barter, my friend. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D28B
 But if you'd like to bet a nice little weapon, we could play a game of Yong. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D116A
 Bubbling black plague! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D116B
 This is an old piece of scrap iron, not a weapon! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D115B
 Find me something else! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D29
 Tell me the rules again. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D30
 Tell me rules... again. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D31A
 It's easy! You're white, I'm black. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D31B
 We take turns, we each put a counter on the board, and we have to turn over at least one enemy counter. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D31C
 To turn over one or more of my counters, you have to surround them with yours. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D31D
 When you turn a counter over, it changes owners and color. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D31E
 The winner is the one who has the most counters on the board when the last square is occupied. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D31F
 Come on. Hand over a nice weapon and let's start! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D129
 Do I have to bet a weapon? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D130
 Have to bet a weapon? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D131
 That's the rules! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D32
 Are we going to play? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D33
 Gonna play? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D34
 Sit down over there and let's start! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L18D35
 You're pretty good! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L18D36
 You're good! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L18D37
 You were just lucky, that's all! XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L18D38
 Just luck! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D39
 People tell me I'm the best player in the Stallite. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D40
 Thanks. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L18D259
 That was a good game. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L18D260
 Good game. XXX
// Arkhan2 O (exulting) perso2
L18D261
 Ahhh, Hah, Hah, Hah, I wiped you out! XXX
// Arkhan3 O (exulting) perso3
L18D262
 Smoked ya! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D263A
 You were lucky... but you're not bad. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D263B
 Always a pleasure to trade weapons and info with you. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D264A
 I have to admit, you played a good game. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D264B
 But I'm going to keep your weapon in exchange for the information I gave you. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L18D43
 Listen, Sadak, I really need your help. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L18D44
 Sadak, I need help. Now! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D45A
 There's no room in this world for weaklings, Arkhan. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D45B
 You can't get something for nothing, not around here anyway. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D45C
 If you really want me to help you, you'll have to prove yourself. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D45D
 You have to beat me at the game of Yong. And that's final. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L18D102A
 I've had enough of your stupid game! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L18D102B
 Give me what I want, thief! XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L18D103A
 Enough stupid game! XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L18D103B
 Thief! Give me... XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D104A
 Thief?! What right have you to call me a thief, Mr. Fancy-Pants from the Upper City? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D104B
 People who insult me like that don't live to tell the tale! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L18D49
 Have you changed your mind? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L18D50
 Changed your mind? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D51A
 You didn't get the picture the first time, did you? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D51B
 If you want me to help you, you have to prove you can beat me! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D54A
 But I've give you a little hint: XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D54B
 The player who gets to the corners of the board first has the best chance of winning. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L18D52
You better help me, I don't think you want to see me angry! XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L18D53
 Help me, or I'll make trouble! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D265B
 True strength is in the brain, not the brawn! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L18D55
 I need to know who runs things around here. Tell me. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L18D56
 Tell me who I need to talk to here. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L18D57
 If you've got the pull everyone thinks you do, you oughta be able to tell me who I should talk to around here. XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L18D58
 If you're so smart, tell me who runs things here. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D59A
 Not so fast, friend. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D59B
 I challenge you to a game of Yong. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D59C
 If you beat me, I'll tell you what you want to know. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D60
 I need to know how to play, first! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D61
 How do you play? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D90A
 I'm looking for someone. A Guardian of Fire named Zed... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D90B
 Have you or one of your men seen him? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D91A
 I'm looking for a man named Zed. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D91B
 Have your men seen him? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D92A
 Sure, I know Zed. Everyone knows Zed. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D92B
 He's too brave for his own good. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D92C
 I heard he came down to the Lower City after the attack on the Great Sunseer. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D92D
 But we lost track of him. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D105
 Shall we play a round? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D106
 Play a game? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D107A
 Great Sun God, looks like you're hooked! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D107B
 You know the price: a weapon. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D107C
 If you win, I'll give you ammo for the thunderbolts from Before. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L18D63
 I'm looking for an antidote to the poison eating away at me. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L18D64
 I'm looking for a cure. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D65A
 You're not planning to go to the healers, I gather... XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D65B
 Maybe you should talk to Leona, if you can find her. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L18D266
 Leona? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L18D267
 Leona? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D666A
 She's a hermit. She lives outside the Stallite, in the Darklands. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D666B
 But no one knows exactly where. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L18D66
 I won! Now, quick! Tell me how I can be healed! XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L18D67
 I won! Give me the cure. Quick! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D68A
 You're right. You won. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D68B
 But men have died before this for talking to me like that! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D68C
 If you can't keep a civil tongue in your mouth, you'd better make tracks. Now! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D69
 This Leona, how can I find her? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D70
 How find Leona? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D71A
 If what people say is true, you don't find her, she finds you. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D71B
 But you'll have a bit of a hard time to make it out of the Stallite. The Guardians of Fire have closed all the gates. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D72A
 The Konkalites? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D72B
 Where's their hideout? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D73
 Where Konkalites hide-out? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D74
 Somewhere down in the sewers! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D75
 Do the Konkalites have a weak spot? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D76
 Konkalites. Where... weak spot? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D77A
 Sure! Their chief is a disgusting crud! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D77B
 His name's Sordos. He used to be one of us. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D77C
 He already sees himself ruling the Stallite by fire and the sword. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D77D
 But what a creep he is! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D78
 What about Dhorkan? I don't understand why you brought him up. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D79
 Why Dhorkan? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D80A
 That, my boy, is another story. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D80B
 In exchange for a fine weapon, I could tell you more... XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D80C
 If you beat me at Yong, of course! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D81
 Does Dhorkan come down here openly? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D82
 Dhorkan just waltzes in here? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D83A
 No. He's wily. He sneaks around. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D83B
 But I've got men everywhere, and they keep their eyes open. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D83C
 We think he's visited the Konkalites at least ten times since the last moon. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D83D
 And there are some who say he opened the Condemned Door and went inside. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D268
 The Condemned Door? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D269
 Condemned Door? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D270A
 Actually, it's the door to a building from Before. Not far from here. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D270B
 No one's ever managed to open it. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D270C
 And people say everyone who tried, later died a mysterious death... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D271
 Is this true? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D272
 Is it true? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D273A
 I couldn't tell you. But you often find dead animals around there. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D273B
 So the local Scavengers put some skulls near that door that everyone's so interested in. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D273C
 Just to discourage the tourists. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D84A
 I'm looking for a crypt. A secret place known only to the Sunseers. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D84B
 Ring any bells? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D85
 And a secret crypt, known only to Sunseers? Know anything about that? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D86A
 Yes... I've heard rumors about it. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D86B
 Underground, a source of energy... XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D86C
 The entrance is supposed to be somewhere in the Upper City. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D86D
 Don't know any of the details... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D87A
 I'm looking for some cut crystals. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D87B
 Have you or your men seen anything like that around here? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D88A
 Looking for crystals. Cut crystals. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D88B
 You or your men seen any? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D89A
 No,I've never seen anything like that around here. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D89B
 But if I do, I'll let you know. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D275
 How about that? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D276
 How about that? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D277A
 Let's see... XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D277B
 A pact between Dhorkan and Sordos. Those blockheads made a written agreement! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D277C
 Must have been the Provost's idea. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D277D
 Sordos doesn't even know how to read. It's all scribble to him! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L18D93A
 I found the body of a Wanderer on the ramparts of the Stallite. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L18D93B
 He had this Yong counter on him. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L18D93C
 I thought maybe you'd be interested... XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L18D94A
 On the ramparts. Saw... Wanderer. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L18D94B
 Had this on him. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L18D94C
 Reminded me of you... XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L18D96A
 Out on the ramparts, there's a Wanderer... dead. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L18D96B
 I found this Yong counter on him. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L18D96C
Look familiar? XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L18D97A
 On the ramparts, there's a Wanderer... He's dead. XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L18D97B
 I found this on him. XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L18D97C
 It's yours, isn't it? XXX
// Armal Sadak (subdued) perso6
L18D95A
 This counter... It's the one I gave to Lodar! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D95B
 What happened to him, tell me! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D284
 Mm... Stomach wound. Mortal. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D285
 Mm... wounded... Mortal wound. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D286
 Looks like a Konkalite did it. Ripped him to shreds. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D287
 A Konkalite did it. Didn't have a chance. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D95C
 Lodar was my friend... and a great Yong player. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D95D
 I'm grateful to you for returning the counter. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D95E
 I want to thank you for what you did. Take this helmet, in memory of a courageous Wanderer. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D111
 How about this weapon? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D112
 This one, how about it? XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D113
 Perfect. XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D114
 Sit down and let's play! XXX
// Armal Sadak perso6
L18D115A
 It's not exactly new! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L18D162
 Hey! Get up! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L18D163
 Forget it! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L18D164
 Hey! Get up! XXX

// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D167
 Hey! look at that! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D168
 Hey, look... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L18D169
 Can't get anything out of him! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L18D170
 Nothing out of him! XXX
// Arkhan2 G (searching among the objects) perso2
L18D173
 Stuff a sailor would have... XXX
// Arkhan3 G (searching among the objects) perso3
L18D174
 Sailor's stuff... XXX
// Malrot2 (irritated) perso62
L18D183A
 Did you hear what I said? XXX
// Malrot2 perso62
L18D183B
 Hands off my Stohll! XXX
// Malrot2 perso62
L18D182A
 This ain't your shack, buddy! XXX
// Malrot2 perso62
L18D182B
 So keep your paws off of my Stohll supply. XXX
// Malrot2 perso62
L18D176
 Hey go ahead, help yourself! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L08D71
 No, the flask is already full. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L08D72
 The flask is full! XXX
// Malrot2 (jovial) perso62
L18D181
 Ah hey, if your gourd's too heavy, I could help you lighten the load! XXX
