I have nevertheless discovered the manuscripts of Thelen Khron, the first Initiate and founder of Sparta, who organized the construction of the Stallite over the site of the Tomb.  XXX

// Rylsadhar
LCOD102B
According to what I deciphered in his secret writings, and my own research, I now believe that the Tomb lies under our very feet, directly under Sparta.  XXX

// Rylsadhar
LCOD102C
Thelen Khron says once the Initiate has entered the Tomb, he must show his loyalty to the Runkas by reciting the ritual mantra.  XXX

// Rylsadhar
LCOD102D
According to my translation, it says: the Runkas... uh... Children... Children of Sun... come from the... from the sun... come from the star... to save the world threatened... destroyed by the Shankrs." XXX


// Rylsadhar
LCOD102E
But I haven't yet been able to find the entrance to the Tomb. I fear it was blocked off during the Cataclysm, and that we have been barred from entering the Tomb of the Children of the Sun.  XXX
