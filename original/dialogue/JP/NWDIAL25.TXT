L25D56A
 Kalhi... don't panic... XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L25D56B
 Listen, I had to go to the hospital. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L25D56C
 A Guardian of Fire jumped me. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L25D56D
 He didn't recognize me, he thought I was a Creature of Darkness. XXX

L25D57D
 And the Guardians of Fire are looking everywhere for the culprits. XXX
// Kalhi (moved) perso13
L25D57E
 I'm afraid of what'll happen if they find me! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L25D94A

L25D94B
 Do you know what this could be? XXX

L25D95
 No, you know I never learned to read... XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L25D101A
 No, nothing. XXX
