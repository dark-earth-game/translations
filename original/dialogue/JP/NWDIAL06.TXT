L06D28Z
 Thy cup runneth over!  Prepare to die! XXX
// Phedoria (alarmed) perso26
L06D84
 The Provost! XXX
// Phedoria perso26
L06D07
 Arkhan! Murderer! XXX
// Phedoria perso26
L06D62
 Freeze, Dhorkan. You're my prisoner! XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D39
 Dark-souled idiots! You'll never get me! XXX
// Phedoria (fires at Dhorkan and misses) perso26
L06D40
 Blasted fire! I missed! XXX

// Dhorkan perso11
L06D18C
 Oh, get out of my sight, you're stinking up the room! XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D20
 Get out, you twisted wreck, or I'll run my sword straight through you! XXX
// Dhorkan (arrogant) perso11
L06D26A
 Do you really think you can get me? You're nothing but a decaying wreck of a man! XXX
// Dhorkan (arrogant) perso11
L06D26H
 You... you're nothing but a pitiful wreck. You don't scare me! XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D05G
 Arkhan! Wait, don't go! XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D54A
 Arkhan! XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D54B
 Let me make myself perfectly clear: I'll do you a favor, but don't come back here until you have some information for me! XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D54C
 From now on, I'm the one who runs this Stallite.  XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D54D
 And don't you forget it, or you'll spend the rest of your days languishing in a dank prison-cell. XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D54E
 That's the fate that awaits anyone who dares rise up against me!  XXX
// Arkhan1 G perso1
L06D09A
 A mechanism. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L06D09B
 A mechanism, like a lock. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L06D09C
 A mechanism. XXX
// Arkhan2G perso2
L06D669
 Dhorkan must have fled through here.... XXX
// Arkhan3G perso3
L06D670
 Dhorkan must have fled through here.... XXX
// Arkhan1 L (not happy about being put on guard duty) perso1
L06D10A
 Provost Dhorkan, perhaps I could be more useful... uh...  XXX
// Arkhan1 O (not happy about being put on guard duty) perso1
L06D10B
 Guard duty with Jedar? Oh, no! Don't you need me somewhere else? XXX
// Dhorkan (irritated) perso11
L06D10C
 That's enough, Arkhan! The orders came directly from the Great Sunseer Lory herself!  XXX
// Dhorkan (irritated) perso11
L06D10D
  Go down and report to your post immediately! XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L06D11A
 A meeting with the Great Sunseer?  Who wants to see her? XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L06D11B
 Who managed to get the Great Sunseer out of bed at the crack of dawn?  XXX
// Dhorkan (surprised by A's arrogance, then catches himself) perso11
L06D12A
 Who? Now... Watch your tongue, Guardian... just obey orders! XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D12B
 Take your weapons and hurry down to welcome the Great Sunseer. XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L06D01A
 I... XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L06D01B
 But... XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D666
 Go on, report to your post! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L06D13A
 Dhorkan, I'm sick!  XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L06D13B
 The Great Sunseer's attackers... poisoned me with this black filth!  XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L06D13C
 They say I'm one of the enemy.  It's not true: I did my duty, that's all!  XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L06D14A
 Dhorkan, by all that's Dark, call off the Guardians of Fire! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L06D14B
 The scum who attacked Lory poisoned me... and now the Guardians themselves are trying to kill me! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L06D14C
 I carried out my duty... I'm on your side.  You have to protect me!  XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso2
L06D63
 Lory's attackers poisoned me... Everyone is out to get me.  I need your help!  XXX
// Arkhan3 O (irritated) perso2
L06D64
 Dhorkan, I'm sick... my life is in danger. You have to help me! XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D45A
 Calm down, calm down... XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D45B
 What did Thanandar the healer, have to say? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L06D46A
 He told me about a crypt, and a remedy it's supposed to hold....  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L06D46B
 He told me to see my father.... that my father could take me there.  XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L06D47A
 He talked about a crypt, a cure.  Said my father could take me.  XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D65A
 Nonsense! Thanandar lied to you to give you hope. XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D65B
 The truth is... the Sunseers no longer control the situation.  XXX
// Dhorkan (bragging) perso11
L06D65C
 That's why I was forced to take command of the Stallite!  XXX
// Dhorkan (suddenly affable) perso11
L06D65D
 You know how much respect I have for your father and the Great Sunseer Lory.  XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D65E
 I declared martial law in order to protect them more efficiently. XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D65F
 As for you... You were definitely a good Guardian of Fire. XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D65G
 But now, who could swear you can still be trusted? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L06D72A
 Dhorkan, I swear by the Sun God....I have done no evil. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L06D72B
 May Thanandar the healer be my witness... I'm still a man. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L06D73A
 I haven't done anything! It's everyone else... they're all afraid of me! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L06D73B
 I'm still a man. Ask the healer! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L06D74
 I'm no traitor! But now nobody trusts me! XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L06D75
 But I've done nothing wrong! XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D76A
 Maybe not, but Thanandar should never have let you go... XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D76B
 He should stick to healing. Giving advice is beyond his competence! XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D76C
 I don't trust him.  If you want to return to your own people, you must prove your loyalty to me. XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D76D
 Go back to Thanandar, then come tell me everything he says and does. XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D76E
 Go! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L06D48A
 I couldn't find Thanandar... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso2
L06D48B
 I couldn't find Thanandar... XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D51A
 Then get out of here.  I've got things to do! XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D51B
 Anyone else would already have clapped you in irons!  XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D51C
 I have great respect for you, but don't try to take advantage of my generosity! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L06D204A
 I went back to see Thanandar. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L06D204B
 He's busy healing someone. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso2
L06D205A
 I saw Thanandar again. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso2
L06D205B
 He's... healing someone. XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D206A
 H'm... very well... XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D206B
 If anything happens, inform me immediately. XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D206C
 Until then, keep a low profile... the other Guardians aren't as charitable as I am. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L06D207A
 I saw Thanandar. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L06D207B
 He's trying to fix Dulnys's face. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L06D207C
 After what I did to him, it won't be easy!  XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L06D208A
 I saw Thanandar. XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L06D208B
 He's wasting time trying to save Dulnys! XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L06D208C
 After what I gave him... it'll take a miracle from the Sun God! XXX
// Dhorkan (angry) perso11
L06D209A
 Arkhan, don't forget to whom you are speaking! XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D209B
 And if I were you, I wouldn't come here bragging about having roughed up a Guardian of Fire. XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D209C
 Get out of here, before I forget how much I like you!  XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L06D210
 Thanandar is still at Dulnys' bedside. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L06D211
 Thanandar is still busy stitching up Dulnys. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L06D212
 Thanandar is still taking care of Dulnys. XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L06D213
 Thanandar's busy stitching up Dulnys! XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D214A
 You needn't have bothered to come back just to tell me that.  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L06D49A
 I had to kill Thanandar! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L06D49B
 I didn't have any choice... He attacked me first! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L06D49C
 And there was someone else with him... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L06D50A
 I killed Thanandar, him and another guy... XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D77A
 Thanandar's dead? Excellent! My fears were groundless.  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L06D78
 Yes, but wait.. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L06D79
 Wait... XXX
// Dhorkan (interrupting Arkhan) perso11
L06D80A
 Arkhan, I'm a man of my word.  I'm going to let you go... XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D80B
 But don't ever try to cross me! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L06D21A
 My father told me he was going to pay you a visit... where is he?  XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L06D21B
 My father came to see you... Tell me where he is! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L06D21C
 Where is my father? XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L06D21D
 You're gonna tell me where my father is! XXX
// Dhorkan (pretending not to know where Rylsadhar is) perso11
L06D22A
 Your father? Well, how should I know? I imagine he's gone into hiding somewhere...  somewhere safe. XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D22B
 Now make yourself scarce... if you want to keep out of the stockade! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L06D52A
 But, shouldn't we... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L06D52B
 Dhorkan, wait... XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D53A
 Arkhan! The Sunseers are not nearly as charitable as I am.  XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L06D15A
 Dhorkan, I need your help. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L06D81A
 So that's it, then!  You don't need me anymore, so you get rid of me! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L06D81B
 Dhorkan, you're not worthy of your rank. You disgust me! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L06D15C
 Dhorkan, please. If you don't help me, I haven't got a chance! XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L06D15D
 You stinking pus-bag, you're throwing me out! XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D16B
 You attacked the Guardians of Fire... That alone merits banishment!  XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D16C
 I used to respect you, so I'm going to let you go.  XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D16D
 If it's help you're looking for, go whine to the Sunseers! XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D16E
 They're responsible for your sad fate!  XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L06D17A
 And the crypt Thanandar mentioned to me... XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L06D17B
 At least tell me what you know about the crypt! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L06D17C
 What do you know about the crypt? XXX
// Dhorkan (scornful) perso11
L06D18A
 The crypt... something else the Sunseers invented to fool you.  XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D18B
 Take my advice: forget all those lies. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L06D19A
 You disappoint me, Dhorkan.  XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L06D19B
 You call yourself a master, but you're nothing but a coward! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L06D19C
 I swear by my torch... you're nothing but a coward!  XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L06D19D
 You're throwing me out! XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L06D19E
 Traitor! XXX
// Arkhan2 G (plays his trump) perso2
L06D23A
 Listen... let's talk about... SORDOS! XXX
// Arkhan3 G (plays his trump) perso3
L06D23B
 Mmm... Let's talk about... SORDOS! XXX
// Dhorkan (caught off-balance) perso11
L06D24
 What? What... What are you insinuating? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L06D25A
 I know everything. And I want an explanation! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L06D25B
 I know everything!  XXX
// Arkhan3 G (threatening) perso3
L06D25D
 I know everything, you madman. XXX
// Dhorkan (arrogant) perso11
L06D26B
 You think you know everything, but your diseased mind understands nothing.  XXX
// Dhorkan (arrogant) perso11
L06D26C
 I have great plans for this Stallite.  XXX
// Dhorkan (arrogant) perso11
L06D26D
 The Sunseers are weak... they're incapable of making the necessary decisions.  XXX
// Dhorkan (arrogant) perso11
L06D26E
 My reign will usher in a new era! XXX
// Dhorkan (arrogant) perso11
L06D26F
 And if I have to work with a slime like Sordos in order to impose my grand designs on the miserable maggots populating Sparta, then... XXX
// Dhorkan (arrogant) perso11
L06D26G
 I'll do it in a flash! XXX
// Dhorkan (disdainful) perso11
L06D26I
 Tell me, who would believe a fungus like you is still human?  XXX
// Dhorkan (disdainful) perso11
L06D26J
 Your own friends have turned against you!  XXX
// Arkhan2 G (threatening) perso2
L06D27
 I swear by the light of the Sun God, I'll expose your real face to the entire world!  XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L06D667A
 Where ever you go, whatever it takes... I'll get you! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L06D667B
 They'll all know who the real monster is!  XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D28A
 No one will believe you. You need proof. XXX
// Dhorkan perso11
L06D28B
 And you don't have any! XXX
// Arkhan1 G perso1
L06D200
 Provost, do you know what this is? XXX
// Dhorkan (dry) perso11
L06D203
 Enough! What do I care?! XXX
// Arkhan1 G perso1
L06D66
 Watch your step, Dhorkan! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L06D67
 Die, Dhorkan! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L06D68
 Die! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L06D69
 Your hour has come, traitor! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L06D70
 Die, traitor! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L06D33A
 A secret passage! Let's go after him! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L06D33C
 Get him! XXX
// Phedoria (to herself) perso26
L06D34A
 I didn't know there was a passage here. XXX
// Phedoria perso26
L06D34B
 Don't just stand there, go after him! XXX
// Phedoria (furious) perso26
L06D60
 That's enough! Get Dhorkan! XXX
// Phedoria perso26
L23D107
 You've sealed your fate! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L06D55C
 Not a trace. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L06D55D
 No trace. XXX
// Phedoria perso26
L06D61A
 You go that way! XXX
// Phedoria perso26
L06D61B
 I'll try to open the passage! XXX
