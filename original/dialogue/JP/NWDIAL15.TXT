 Arkhan, I explained to Danrys... XXX
// Danrys (back turned) perso9
L15D116
 You call that an explanation?! You show up shouting, waving your hands around and prattling on faster than a Sunseer in his pulpit! XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L15D136
 Euh... Danrys, you should look at Arkhan... XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L15D459
 Arkhan, at last! You're here! XXX
// Danrys (back turned) perso9

// Kalhi (stunned, confused) perso13
L03D500A
 Arkhan! You... Why did you do that? XXX
// Kalhi (crippled) perso13
L03D500B
 It's the poison... it's driving you mad! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D76C
 You've gone crazy! XXX
// Kalhi (upset because A. is hitting Danrys)perso13
L15D456
 Arkhan, no! XXX
// Kalhi (going in front of A.)perso13
L15D135A
 There you are! XXX
// Kalhi (going in front of A.)perso13
L15D135B
 I saw you coming... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D02A
 In the name of the Sun God! Arkhan! You're... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D137A
 ...Stricken. I was protecting Lory, and got infected by the evil Archessence. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D137B
 ...Stricken... Infected by this poison while protecting Lory. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D02Z
 You're not a pretty sight. Not at all... XXX
// Arkhan2 G (speaking to D., who's working) perso2
L15D01A
 Hey, Danrys! XXX
// Arkhan3 G (speaking to D., who's working) perso3
L15D01B
 Danrys! XXX
// Danrys perso9

 Danrys! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D97A
 I can't hear you! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D97B
 Let me turn off the grinding wheel! XXX
// Danrys (turns off the grinding wheel) perso9
L15D03C
 Ah, the calm after the storm! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D98
 Who's there? Arkhan, is it you? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D99
 Ah! It was you! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D101
 Okay! Stop the grinding wheel! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D900A
 There you go! I carved the crystal you wanted. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D900B
 Obviously it's not perfect, but it ought to work... XXX
// Danrys (gives the weapon back to Arkhan) perso9
L15D900C
 There you go! As good as new! XXX
// Danrys (gives the weapon back to Arkhan) perso9
L15D900D
 Sorry, Arkhan... It was too fragile, I broke it! XXX
// Danrys (calls after the departing A.) perso9
L15D505
 Wait! Your weapon! XXX
// Danrys (catching up to A.) perso9
L15D504
 Bring it back to me if you really want me to fix it... XXX
// Danrys (confronted with an aggressive A.) perso9
L15D04
 Arkhan, calm down! It's me, Danrys, your old friend! XXX
// Danrys (A. calming down) perso9

L15D84B
 The last crystal! The key is complete! XXX
// Arkhan2 G (discovering D. dead) perso2
L15D113A
 Danrys... not you! Not my friend! XXX
// Arkhan3 G (discovering D. dead) perso3
L15D113B
 Danrys... you too! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D114A
 They're going to pay for this! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D114B
They're going to pay for this! XXX
// Danrys (A. hits D.) perso9
L15D76A
 Hey! Take it easy! XXX
// Kalhi (afraid) perso33
L04D41
 Arkhan! What's come over you? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D300A
 Danrys... I need your help, my friend. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D300B
 Up above, the Guardians of Fire are after me. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D301A
 I'm in bad trouble, Danrys! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D301B
 I can't trust anyone... except for you and Kalhi. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D301C
 Up above, the Sunseers and Guardians of Fire want my scalp. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L15D302A
 Danrys, help me... XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L15D302B
 The malady is taking over my body and turning me into a beast! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L15D302C
 Up above, they want me dead. XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L15D303A
 Danrys, help me, I'm going to die... XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L15D303B
 This blasted poison is eating me alive. XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L15D303C
 And up above, They all want me dead! XXX
// Kalhi (irascible)perso13
L15D304A
 It's true. Dhorkan has gained control of the Upper City. XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L15D304B
 The Guardians of Fire threw me in prison... XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L15D304C
 And they're hunting for Arkhan. They're going to kill him! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D305
 Calm down, Kalhi. Easy does it. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D306A
 Arkhan, you know you can count on me. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D306B
 I'll do anything to help you... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D08A
 Can you repair this weapon? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D08B
 This weapon? Repair it? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D901A
 No. I can do nothing with the thunderbolts from Before. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D901B
 Too many parts. I don't have the right tools. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D11A
 It looks like it's in good shape. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D11B
 Just make sure you've got the right ammunition. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D11C
 It's practically as good as new. I don't see what I could do... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D09
 Yes, I think... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D21C
 Go over there and turn the grinding wheel on! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D131A
 Your weapon is broken. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D131B
 There's nothing I can do, sorry... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D12C
 Would this be any use to you for making a flame-thrower? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D12D
 You think this'll work for the flame-thrower? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D14A
 Let's have a look... Hum... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D14B
 Yes... Yes... That ought to work just fine. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D14C
 Give it to me. It's worth trying. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D14D
 I'm going to make this weapon for you. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D14E
 With this baby, no one will even look at you the wrong way! XXX
// Arkhan2 G (showing the bow)perso2
L15D322
 I'm looking for crystals... XXX
// Arkhan3 G (showing the bow from the key)perso3
L15D323
 I'm looking for crystals... XXX
// Danrys (intrigued)perso9
L15D324
 By the black plague, what was that? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D325A
 My father had a key made from four pieces of crystal. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D325B
 Then he gave each piece to a different person. People he trusted. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D325C
 Lory was one of them, she gave me the bow of the key. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D325D
 But I still have to find the three other crystals. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D326A
 Let me finish! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D326B
 My father had a key made out of four crystals. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D326C
 The problem is, he gave them away, and I don't know who he gave them to. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D326D
 The Great Sunseer gave me one. But I've got to find the others, fast. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D327A
 Four crystals that form a key. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D327B
 My father. He gave the pieces away. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D327C
 I've got to find them, fast. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D324Y
 I haven't seen many crystals like that before. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D324Z
 Luminous objects like that. That's something a Sunseer would have. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D328
 Lory told me Bandor the Master Builder might have one. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D329
 Lory thinks the Master Builder has one... maybe. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D330A
 Bandor! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D330B
 Well, lately, he's been spending a lot of time in the Lower City with his architects... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D330C
 But with everything that's going on, I'm sure he fled back up to his palace. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D330D
 If you go see him, don't be too rough with him. He's a terrible sissy. XXX
// Danrys (indicates the word "diagram") perso9
L15D330E
 If it hadn't been for his dreams and his diagrams, he would never have dared come down here...XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D331
 You don't know who my father gave the crystals to? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D332
 Who could my father have given the crystals to? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D333
 Well, I don't know. Not to me, in any case... XXX
// Danrys (A. asking the question again) perso9
L15D334
 No, really. I told you, I don't know... XXX
// Arkhan2 G (shows crystal without showing the bow)perso2
L15D335
 Can you find me a crystal like this one? XXX
// Arkhan3 G (shows crystal without showing the bow)perso3
L15D336
 Would you have a crystal like this? XXX
// Danrys (intrigued)perso9
L15D337
 What is it? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D338A
 I have to reassemble a crystal key that belonged to my father. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D338B
 I need the four pieces, but I haven't found them. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D338C
 Would you be able to find one for me? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D339A
 My father had a key made up of four pieces. He gave one piece to each of four different people...but I don't know who! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D339B
 I need this key, and I need it fast! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D339C
 Maybe you can find me something to replace the missing piece with. XXX
// Danrys (thinking) perso9
L15D340A
 Yes...Yes... Uhmmm... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D340B
 If this is a key with three notches and a bow, I'd need to see the other notches... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D340C
 Then I could guess at the shape of the missing piece and make one to replace it. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D341
 I've got one of the crystals... But the others are still missing. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D342
 Can you make one for me? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D343
 Can you? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D344
 Yes. But as I said, I'd have to see the other notches first. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D345
 Here's another crystal, just as you asked. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D346
 You wanted another crystal? Here it is! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L15D347
 Here's another crystal. XXX
// Arkhan3 O (grunting)perso3
L15D348
 Other crystal. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D23A
 Well, let's see now... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D23B
 Right, it's the Rahal, the Sunseers' symbol. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D23C
 I should be able to cut a crystal to the right dimensions. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D23D
 The problem will be how to find one now. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D23E
 You don't find that kind of raw material just lying around... XXX
// Danrys (1st time) perso9
L15D24B
 A rough quartz should do, once it's been carved. XXX
// Danrys (2nd time) perso9
L15D24A
 I told you, go find me some quartz... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D21A
 I'll be able to make the missing piece for you... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D21B
 Turn the grinding wheel on, I'll get started right away. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D608
 It's a substance from Before, an explosive. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D609
 A substance from Before. Explosive. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D610
 Interesting... But what are you going to do with it? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D611
 I don't know yet... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D612
 I don't know. Not yet, anyway. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D604
 You know what it is? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D605
 You know what it is? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D607A
 I told you, Bogdaran can tell you what it is better than I can. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D607B
 He's a whiny pain in the butt, but he knows a lot. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D606A
 An object from Before... There's a weird substance inside... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D606B
 You should show it to Bogdaran, the Master Oiler. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D468
 I found this stone outside. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D469
 Take a look at this stone XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D470
 Found this stone... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D471
 Rock crystal! Thanks. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D350
 I think I found the rock crystal you wanted! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D351
 I hope that's what you wanted. I nearly killed myself getting it! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L15D352
 I think I've got the rock crystal. XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L15D353
 (grunting) This what you wanted? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D354
 Well done, Arkhan! Now I can make the missing piece. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D356A
 Don't need it. I finally found the last crystal. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D356B
 Keep it. You've got more use for it that I do! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D357A
 No need. I found it. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D357B
 But you can keep that one. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D600
 Can you read this? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D601
 What's it say? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D602
 Read it! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D603A
 Listen Arkhan, you know that reading isn't my strong suit. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D603B
 I can't help you with that kind of thing... XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D358A
 I found this diagram in the Konkalites' hideout. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D358B
 Ever seen one of these? Can you tell me what it is? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D359A
 I got my hands on this diagram. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D359B
 You know everything, so tell me something. Was it worth beating the life out of its owner to get it? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L15D360
 This diagram... You know what it is? XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L15D361
 This diagram... what is it? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D362A
 Let me see... Hum... Yes, I know what this is... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D362B
 It's the design of a new weapon invented by the Builders. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D362C
 And I do remember hearing that it had been stolen. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D362D
 All hell broke loose when it disappeared, but Dhorkan never really looked very hard for it ... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D362E
 And since the Sun God has placed it in your hands, it would be interesting to see if I could build their precious "flame-thrower". XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D363
 Flame-thrower? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D364
 Flame-thrower? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D365A
 Mmm, yes, that's what they call it. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D365B
 It's a heavy-bore weapon that spits out flasks filled with flaming liquid. XXX
// Danrys (looking at the diagram) perso9
L15D365C
 Springs... firing mechanism... trigger. I should be able to find the parts for it... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D365D
 What I need is a big handle to hold it steady and activate the mechanism. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D365E
 Look, why don't you go look for a handle while I take care of the rest. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D365F
 Go bug the diagram's previous owner, maybe this time you can get the handle out of him. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D463
 No, he's in no shape to talk. But I'll find one. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D464
 He won't be saying anything for a while! But I'll find one. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D366A
 I found this canister from Before... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D366B
 When you press the little round thing on top, air comes out hissing like a snake. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D367A
 Here's a canister from Before... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D367B
 When you press on the round thing, it hisses... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D368A
 Yes, I've seen one of those. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D368B
 With the motor on the bottom of the canister, you can suck air out or blow it in. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D368C
 It also works on the cans from Before. You know, the ones with the dried food inside. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D369
 What were you saying about this canister? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D370
 Tell me more about this canister. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D371A
 You see that relic from Before at the back of my workshop? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D371B
 It's called a "motor". You can use it to suck air out of a canister or to fill it up again from the other side. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D371C
 The people from Before used these canisters for breathing under water. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D371D
 They carried their own air with them in canisters like the one you've got there. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D371E
 Alas! If you young people don't listen to me a little more attentively, everything I know will disappear when I go to meet the Great Sun God... XXX
// Arkhan2 L (tin can)perso2
L15D372
 You gave this to the Provider-Woman outside, didn't you? What is it? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D373A
 This can, you gave it to the Provider-Woman, didn't you? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D373B
 You don't have to tell me what she gave you in exchange... I just want to know what it is! XXX
// Danrys (not amused) perso9
L15D375A
 Ha, ha, ha! Very funny! Looks like the poison is rotting your brain! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D374
 What's this can? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D375B
 The people from Before dried their food and kept it in cans like this. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D375C
 And they put it in cans like this one. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D376
 And what do you think of this, Danrys? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D377
 Danrys, have you seen this? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D378
 Forget about it. You've got better things to do than moonlight as a Scavenger. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D379
 I don't know what it's for, sorry. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D380A
 You want me to bring back a handle for the flame-thrower. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D380B
 What would it look like? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D381
 Look, since I gotta scavenge for you and find the handle for the flame-thrower, at least tell me what it looks like. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D382
 What kind of flame-thrower handle? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D383A
 It's got to be strong and big enough to fit in your hand. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D383B
 We have to attach it on top, and on either side of the barrel. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D383C
 I'd say about three inches wide, more or less. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D383D
 Try to find something that looks like that and I'll take care of the rest. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D384
 Explain again about the handle. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3

 Tell me again about the handle. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D386A
 Are you trying to drive me crazy or what? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D386B
 A metal handle that hooks onto the barrel, got it? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D386C
 If you can't find anything, too bad! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D387
 So, have you made my flame-thrower? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D388
 Hey, is my flame-thrower finished? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L15D389
 So, the flame-thrower? XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L15D390
 I want my flame-thrower! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D391A
 I'm not finished. Don't be in such a hurry! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D391B
 Give me a little more time, okay? XXX
// Danrys (irritated)perso9
L15D392A
 You think it's easy to build one of these things? XXX
// Danrys (irritated)perso9
L15D392B
 Give me more time, okay! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D393A
 Here's your flame-thrower! I even loaded it for you. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D393B
 But be careful, you don't have much ammo. XXX
// Danrys (irritated) perso9
L15D394A
 There it is! You see, no need to keep at me like that! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D394B
 It's loaded, but use it sparingly. Ammo is hard to come by. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D395
 Kalhi isn't here? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D396
 Where did Kalhi go?! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L15D397
 Where's Kalhi? XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L15D398
 Kalhi?! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D399A
 She left a little while ago... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D399B
 She said she couldn't stand seeing you like that and not do something to help. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D399C
 You know how she is. Headstrong! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D400
 Kalhi isn't with you? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D401
 Where is she this time? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L15D402
 Kalhi isn't here? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D403A
 No, she left again. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D403B
 She couldn't sit still... XXX
// Arkhan2 G (worried)perso2
L15D404
 Where did Kalhi go? XXX
// Arkhan3 G (worried)perso3
L15D405
 Kalhi... Where is she? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D406A
 I don't know where she is, but you should try to find her. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D406B
 Hurry up. With things the way they are, I'm worried about her! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D902
 Danrys... Kalhi is dead... XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D903
 Kalhi?! She's dead? Dead! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L15D904
 Danrys... Kalhi... dead! XXX

L15D905
 Kalhi is dead! Arghhhh! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D906A
 No! XXX
// Danrys (heartbroken)perso9
L15D906B
 Poor child.... So full of life... Too young to die ... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D906C
 Hang in there, Arkhan! If you give up now, she will have died in vain! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D906D
 If you loved her, fight to save the world that she loved, the world she created in your heart every day! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D906E
 If you want to stay human, you've got to fight! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D55A
 I've got to find a way to heal myself. And fast! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D55B
 I have to find a cure, fast. XXX
// Danrys (thinking) perso9
L15D56A
 A cure... Yes... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D56B
 There's nothing much I can do. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D56C
 Around here, the person who could help you is Armal Sadak. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D457
 I've already talked to him. I don't know if he can really help me. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D458
 I've seen him. I'm not sure he can help. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D57A
 Who is this guy, Armal Sadak? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D57B
 Tell me about Armal Sadak. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D58A
 He knows a lot about a lot of things... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D58B
 He lives near here, in a kind of big metal boat. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D58C
 Most of the Scavengers in these parts work for him. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D58D
 He provides protection. In return, they give him a share of what they find. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D500
 You too? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D501
 And you? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D502A
 It's different with me. I don't owe him anything, and he leaves me alone. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D502B
 And like everyone else, he's happy that I'm there when he needs me... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D502C
 No matter what happens, when you ask for his help, watch your back. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D502D
 Armal Sadak never does anything without a reason. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D550A
 I went to Armal Sadak's boat. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D550B
 I can tell you one thing, they aren't a very talkative bunch! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D551A
 I went to Armal Sadak's boat. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D551B
 But those guys don't talk much! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D552A
 Hmm... obviously, they don't know who you are... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D552B
 I should have known they'd throw you out. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D552C
 Listen, go back and tell them I sent you. And give them this password: XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D552D
 "Mankind is but a pawn that the hand of Destiny moves sometimes into the Darkness, and sometimes into the Light." XXX
// Arkhan2 G (repeating) perso2
L15D553
 Mankind is but a pawn... that the hand of Destiny... moves sometimes ... into the Darkness and sometimes into the Light. XXX
// Arkhan3 G (repeating) perso3
L15D554
 Mankind is but a pawn... that the hand of Destiny... moves sometimes ... into the Darkness and sometimes into the Light. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D555A
 There. That way you'll know a friend sent you. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D555B
 But be careful, those guys are as hard as nails! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D312A
 Up there, the Sunseers told me about a crypt. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D312B
 A kind of secret place where I'd find the cure for my sickness. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D313A
 The antidote for this filthy poison is supposed to be hidden somewhere in a secret crypt. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D313B
 That's what Thanandar the healer told me. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L15D314A
 The Sunseers say there's a cure. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L15D314B
 In a crypt... somewhere... XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L15D315A
 A cure... XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L15D315B
 Sunseers say it's in some crypt. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D316A
 A secret crypt? What are you talking about? XXX
// Danrys (hesitating) perso9
L15D316B
 I know how badly you want to believe that, but... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D316C
 I think they told you that just to make you feel better. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D317A
 They said the cure was in a secret crypt. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D317B
 I found it, but it didn't cure me. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D318A
 I found a cure in a crypt... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D318B
 But it wasn't enough. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D319A
 There must be another way... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D319B
 Unfortunately, I don't know what it is. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D320A
 Danrys, I found that secret crypt they told me about. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D320B
 But I'm not cured! I must find another way. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D321A
 The secret crypt, I found it... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D321B
 But it didn't cure me! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D307A
 My father seemed to know about this sickness. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D307B
 I was supposed to meet him at the Temple of the Sun God, but he didn't show up. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D307C
 Have you seen him? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D308A
 Apparently, my father knew about this poison. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D308B
 He told me to meet him at the Temple, but then he vanished! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D308C
 You haven't seen him have you? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D309A
 My father knows the cure. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D309B
 I've got to find him! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D309C
 Have you seen him? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D311A
 Your father? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D311B
 No. He rarely comes down into the Lower City. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D311C
 If he is down here anywhere, it must be against his will! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D407A
 Danrys, listen to me. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D407B
 Things could get very dangerous around here. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D407C
 It's more than just the Darkness... There's another one... another "changed" one, like me. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D407D
 Thanandar... It's because of him I'm contaminated... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D407E
 He... He wants to destroy the entire Stallite... And it's already started. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D407F
 So, watch out, my old friend! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso2
L15D408A
 Danrys, listen! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso2
L15D408B
 Things are getting dangerous... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso2
L15D408C
 Not just the Darkness... Another one... "changed," like me. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso2
L15D408D
 Thanandar... He wants to destroy the Stallite. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso2
L15D408E
 And it's already started! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso2
L15D408F
 So, be careful, my friend! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D409A
 I... Yes, all right. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D409B
 Don't worry, I'll be careful! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D409C
 With the Darkness, everyone's afraid... Armal Sadak's men are ready for war. XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D409D
 If things get ugly, I'm sure they'll help me. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D410
 Have you ever heard anyone talk about a place called the "Tomb"? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D411
 The "Tomb," ever heard of it? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D412
 I'm looking for a place called the "Tomb". XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D413
 The Tomb? What is it? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D414A
 According to Lory, and to my father's writings, it's a very secret place. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D414B
 It's supposed to be under the Stallite...But the location of the entrance has been long forgotten. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D414C
 My father said that a "Child of the Sun" is in there. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L15D414D
 Whoever or whatever it may be, it's our last hope if we're going to save Sparta! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D415A
 If you can believe what Lory and my father say, it is a very ancient place. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D415B
 It's supposed to lie under our good old Stallite, but of course no one knows where the door is! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D415C
 But my father said a "Child of the Sun" lies there. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L15D415D
 I don't know what that is, but if it can save Sparta, I'll find it! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L15D416A
 Lory and Rylsadhar said it's a very ancient spot... under the Stallite. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L15D416B
 But no one knows where the entrance is. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L15D416C
 That's where I'll find  " A child of the Sun" . XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L15D416D
 Maybe it's our last hope... to save Sparta. XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L15D417A
 Some ancient spot, lost under the Stallite. XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L15D417B
 I've got to find the entrance... XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L15D417C
 In there, is a... "Child of the Sun". XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L15D417D
 Our last chance! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D418A
 A "Child of the Sun," eh? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D418B
 I hope the Sunseers haven't been telling you tales! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D418C
 As for getting under the Stallite, I'm stumped. We're sitting on a sheer cliff face! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D418D
 Are you planning to dig a tunnel with your fingernails? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D86A
 What's new, my friend? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D86B
 Any news? XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D87
 No, sorry. Hang in there, Arkhan. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2

 Hang in there, my friend. XXX

 This weapon is... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D130B
 This weapon is... XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D103A
 You talk too much! Cut out the chat and turn on the grinding wheel. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D102A
 The crystal, you... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D102B
 The crystal, you... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D95
 You're out of luck, Danrys! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso2
L15D96
 You've had it! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D76B
 Hey! Calm down! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D100A
 Stop this commotion! XXX
// Danrys perso9
L15D100B
 Right now! XXX
// Arkhan2 G (no electricity)perso2
L15D461
 The wheel doesn't work... XXX
// Arkhan3 G (no electricity)perso3
L15D462
 Doesn't work... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D506
 Danrys's grinding wheel, for shaping metal and stone. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D507
 The grinding wheel... for metal, stone. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D112A
 Danrys's grinding wheel has gone dead. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D112B
 The grinding wheel's gone dead... XXX
// Arkhan2 L (in front of the turning grinder)perso2
L15D80A
 Better not touch it... XXX
// Arkhan3 L (in front of the turning grinder)perso3
L15D80B
 No ! Mustn't touch. XXX
// Arkhan2 G (with weapon in front of the grinder)perso2
L15D81A
 No. Each time I try, I break the blade. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D81B
 Only Danrys knows how to do it... XXX
// Arkhan3 G (with weapon in front of the grinder)perso3
L15D81C
 No, I'm going to break the blade. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D81D
 Only Danrys knows how to do it... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D82A
 This crystal doesn't need to be carved... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D82B
 No need to carve the crystal! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D465A
 Yes, I could carve this crystal for the key... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D465B
 But I'd need at least three pieces to carve the last one correctly. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D466A
 Yes, I could carve it... for the key. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso2
L15D466B
 But I need to have at least three pieces before I can make the last one. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D419
 I'm going to carve the crystal myself and finish the key. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D420
 Carve the last crystal to make the key. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D89A
 I already have all the crystals. I don't need that. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D89B
 No need. I already have all the crystals. XXX
// Arkhan2 G (with different objects)perso2
L15D85A
 I can't carve it! XXX
// Arkhan3 G (with different objects)perso3
L15D85B
 It's impossible to carve! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D104A
 One of those old machines from Before. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L15D104B
 A machine from Before. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L15D105A
 Here's the air machine Danrys was talking about. XXX

 Must be Danrys's air machine. XXX

 Poor Danrys! He didn't deserve this. XXX
