L05D13A
 What are you doing here? You don't belong here, Guardian of Fire. XXX
// Bogdaran (unfriendly) perso8
L05D13B
 Beat it, I'm busy! XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D14
 I have to have quiet for my kind of work! XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D15
 Come on... go hang out somewhere else! XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D16

 Eh? What? XXX

 The object from Before. XXX

L05D19
 The object from Before! XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D20A
 Yes, yes... That's very weird stuff you've got there! XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D20B
 This bar inside here, I'm not exactly sure what it is... but you shouldn't get it wet.  XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D20C
 I've covered it with rueg oil,  but be careful, it's still very dangerous! XXX
// Delia (speaking to Bogdaran) perso10
L05D21A
 Bogdaran! You were worried about me...  XXX
// Delia (speaking to Bogdaran) perso10
L05D21B

 Hey! Don't try that again! XXX
// Delia (hit by Arkhan) perso10
L45D04
 What's gotten into you?!? XXX
// Bogdaran (Arkhan1 rummages through his things) perso8
L05D22
 Great Solaar! What are you looking for? XXX
// Bogdaran (playing the innocent) perso8
L05D23A
 Now you wouldn't do that at the Provost's, would you? XXX
// Bogdaran (suddenly loses his cool) perso8
L05D23B
 Because if you keep it up, the Provost's is just where you're going! XXX
// Arkhan1 L (friendly) perso1
L05D24A
 Okay. Guess I'll get moving  XXX
// Arkhan1 L (friendly) perso1
L05D24B
 Light be with you. XXX
// Arkhan1 O (sarcastic) perso1
L05D25
 Yeah, I've enjoyed our little chat! XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D26
 You'd better get out of here! XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L05D27
 I hope I'm not disturbing you.  XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L05D28
 So,  Master Oiler, too busy to talk? XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L05D29
 Hello, Bogdaran. XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L05D30
 Light be with you, Master Bogdaran. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D31
 Sorry, Guardian of Fire, I don't have time to talk to you right now...  XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L05D32
 Of course, I understand. XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L05D33
 Are you always this friendly, or are you making a special effort just for me?  XXX
// Bogdaran (contemptuous) perso8
L05D34
 Mmmf! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L05D35
 There's nothing to fear, I won't do you any harm.. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L05D36
 Stay calm, fatso! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L05D37
 Bogdaran ... calm down! XXX
// Bogdaran (terrified) perso8
L05D39B
 Don't come any closer! Stay right where you are! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L05D40
 Please, stay calm. It's me, Arkhan. I'm a Guardian of Fire like you. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L05D41
 Quit yelling! It's me, Arkhan! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L05D42
 It's me, Arkhan! XXX
// Bogdaran (terrified) perso8
L05D44A
 No! I've never laid my eyes on you before! XXX
// Bogdaran (terrified) perso8
L05D44B
 Help! Help me, Guardians of Fire! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D45A
 Master Oiler, you know the secrets of oils and the mysteries of alchemy. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D45B
 You must know of a cure for the sickness that's eating away at me!  XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D46
 Do you know how to cure me? Speak! XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D47A
 Huh... I... I'd like to help you, but I don't know anything about your disease. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D47B
 The Sunseer healers are the only ones with the power to help you. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D48
 I'm looking for a crypt... A place my father is said to visit every now and then...  XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D49
 I'm looking for a sacred site, a crypt. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D50A
 A crypt? No, I stick to my laboratory. I don't go anywhere else. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D50B
 You should talk to Bandor, the Master Builder. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D50C
 The Stallite holds no secrets for Bandor. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D50D
 But the builders' palace has been closed for several days now.  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D53A
 My father, Rylsadhar, entrusted crystals of light to different people for safekeeping.  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D53B
 Do you have one? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D54
 Did my father give you a crystal? XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D55A
  Your father? No, he's never been to my laboratory. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D55B
 And I don't have any crystals, sorry. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D56
 What do you know about Thanandar? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D57
 Tell me about Thanandar! XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D58A
 He's a Sunseer and a healer. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D58B
 A scholar thirsting for knowledge. There are many who owe their lives to Thanandar. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D58C
 Rumor has it he's been shut up alone in his house lately. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D59
 I'm trying to find Rylsadhar. Have you seen him? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D60
 I'm looking for my father. Have you seen him? XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D61
 Rylsadhar? No, he doesn't come round here often. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D62
 And Zed, do you have any idea where he might be? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D63
Zed, have you seen him? XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D64A
 After your... your accident, Zed came here to pick up some munitions. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D64B
 He wanted to go down into the Lower City and find the heretics.  XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L05D65
 What is this stuff? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L05D66
 This stuff? XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D67
 Give me time to study it first, all right?  XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L05D209
 This stuff... what is it?! XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L05D210
 Argh... The stuff! XXX
// Bogdaran (impressed) perso8
L05D211A
 All right, calm down, I'll take a look at it. XXX
// Bogdaran (impressed) perso8
L05D211B
 But you have to give me a little time, all right?  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D68
 Master Oiler, please analyze this weird stuff for me.  XXX
// Bogdaran (worried) perso8
L05D70A
 Listen, I should know a great deal more very soon. XXX
// Bogdaran (worried) perso8
L05D70B
 But first, I need your help. XXX
// Bogdaran (worried) perso8
L05D70C
 In all this chaos, I greatly fear for someone's life.... a woman. XXX
// Bogdaran (worried) perso8
L05D70D
 Delia. You'll find her in the Lower City... At the "Silver Reed". XXX
// Bogdaran (worried) perso8
L05D70E
 It's a cabaret.   Please... bring her back here to me. XXX
// Bogdaran (worried) perso8
L05D70F
 When Delia stands safely at my side, I'll tell you everything you want to know about this relic from Before.  XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L05D72
 Bogdaran... Delia, she... she's dead. I'm sorry. XXX
// Arkhan2 O (sinister) perso2
L05D73
 This Delia you want me to bring back... she's some female!  XXX
// Bogdaran (distraught and hopeful at once) perso8
L05D74
 Yes? XXX
// Arkhan2 O (nasty) perso2
L05D75
 She's stiff!  Ha Ha... Maybe you could just cover her in a little oil, it might preserve her!  XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D76
 You'll never see Delia again. She's dead. XXX
// Bogdaran (overcome with grief) perso8
L05D77A
 What? No! Delia... No, you're lying! XXX
// Bogdaran (overcome with grief) perso8
L05D77B
 My darling... She's not dead! It's a lie!  XXX
// Bogdaran (abruptly threatening) perso8
L05D77C
 You did it, didn't you?! You killed her!  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D78
 What can you tell me about this object from Before?  XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D79
 Tell me about the object from Before! XXX
// Bogdaran (still uneasy but stubborn) perso8
L05D80A
 As agreed: first you bring Delia back to me... XXX
// Bogdaran (calmer) perso8
L05D80B
 Afterwards, I'll study your relic and tell you what you want to know. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D87
 Have you examined the relic from Before? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D88
 What about the relic from Before? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D89
 Why did you put oil into the relic from Before? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D90
 Why is there oil on the object from Before? XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D91A
 You see the green bar, in the middle? XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D91B
 I poured one little droplet of water on it, and it spit out enough flames to burn my beard! XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D91C
 Oil, on the other hand, is neutral. It's safer like this. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D92
 I have to be going now. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D93
 I'm out of here.  XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D94
 Thank you, Arkhan. Come back if I can be of any help! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D95
 I know where to find you! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D96
 I'll find you! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L05D81
 Sorry to interrupt. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L05D97
 Keeping busy, I see! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D98
 Sorry, was this a bad time? XXX
// Bogdaran (humorless laugh) perso8
L05D99
 Not at all! Heh, heh! Not at all... XXX
// Bogdaran (uncomfortable) perso8
L05D82
 Very well. Light go with you! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D103
 You honestly don't know anything about this disease I've got? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D104
 So you don't know anything about my disease!  XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D105
 No, Arkhan, as I said before, I can't do anything to help... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D108
 If you can think of anything that might help me.... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D109
 If you think of something ... XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D110A
 Don't worry. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D110B
 If I find out anything, you'll be the first to know.  XXX
// Arkhan1 G perso1
L05D111
Alright. What can you tell me about this object? XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D114
 It doesn't ring a bell. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D115
 I found this uniform downstairs! XXX
// Arkhan3 Gperso3
L05D116
 Is this your uniform? XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D117A
 Yes, my first uniform... I was younger then... XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D117B
 I can't get into it anymore... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D118
 If you don't need it, I'll keep your uniform. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D119
 I'm taking your uniform. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D120
 Sure... Sure, go ahead and take it. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D121A
 Careful! It's dangerous! XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D121B
 There's a special oil inside that explodes when it catches fire. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D121C
 It can do incredible damage! XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D122A
 These balls?  That's ammunition for the spitrods.  XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D122B
 But be careful, your spitrod won't work unless you attach a boiler to it. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D123A
 The boiler is vital, it holds the steam for the spitrods. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D123B
 Without the boiler and the ammunition, your spitrod is just a plain old club! XXX
// Bogdaran (impressed) perso8
L05D124A
 Incredible! Marvelous. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D124B
 It looks like a thunderbolt from Before, like the one Zed has.   XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D124C
 But this one is much larger.  XXX
// Bogdaran (curious) perso8
L05D124D
 Have you... tried it? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D125
 None of your business. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D126
 Wouldn't you like to know. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D135A
 You have a flame-thrower? XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D135B
 It's a new weapon the Scavengers invented. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D135C
 But I thought the diagrams had been stolen. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D135D
 Where did you find it? XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D138A
 These sheets are used to make the ammunition for the spitrods. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D138B
 But I don't make them here anymore, it requires too much heat. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D138C
 You'll have to go to the Hall across from the Guard room.  XXX
// Bogdaran (proud of himself) perso8
L05D141A
 A spitrod. Did you know that I'm the one who perfected this weapon? XXX
// Bogdaran (proud of himself) perso8
L05D141B
 I'm the only one who knows how to make the boilers that hold the steam needed to trigger it.  XXX
// Bogdaran (proud) perso8
L05D141C
 A truly ingenious system... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D142A
 Master Oiler, I found this.  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D142B
 It comes from the ruins of Before.  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D142C
 Do you know what it is? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D143A
 I found this in the ruins of Before. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D143B
 Do you know what it is? XXX
// Bogdaran (intrigued) perso8
L05D144A
 H'm... It looks like part of it is broken.  XXX
// Bogdaran (intrigued) perso8
L05D144B
 If you leave it with me, maybe I could take a look at it... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D83
 Here, take it! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso2
L05D84
 Here! XXX
// Bogdaran (interested) perso8
L05D85
 Good! I'll figure out what it is. XXX
// Arkhan1 G perso1
L05D147
 You call that fighting, potbelly? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D148
 I'll teach you how to fight, fatso! XXX
// Arkhan3 G (mocking) perso3
L05D149
 Pot-bellied slob! XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D150B
 Filthy monster! XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D151
 No! Don't kill me! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D152
 So, you think I'm a monster?! OK, fine. Then I'll act like a monster! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D153
 You don't leave me any other choice... XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D154
 No, listen, all right! I'll do what you ask! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D155
 Will you listen to me and try to help me? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D156
 Listen to me and help me! XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D157
 I swear by the Great Solaar! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D158
 You'd better keep your word! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D159
 You better keep your word! XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D160A
 I know! I'll help you... XXX
// Bogdaran (feigning unconcern) perso8
L05D160B
 Anyway, if you really wanted to kill me, you'd have done it already, right? XXX
// Arkhan1 G perso1
L05D162
 The oil barrel hasn't been filled.  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D163
 The oil barrel still isn't full. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D164
 There's still no oil. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D165A
 Don't touch that! XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D165B
 The oil hasn't been refined yet. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D168
 Rueg oil. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D169
 Oil! XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D170
 Hey! Don't waste my oil! XXX
// Arkhan2 L (to Delia) perso2
L05D171
 I'm glad I managed to bring you back. XXX
// Arkhan2 O (to Delia) perso2
L05D172
 Stop shaking, you're there! XXX
// Arkhan3 G (to Delia) perso3
L05D212
 We made it. XXX
// Delia perso10
L05D173
 Many thanks, Arkhan. May the Great Solaar watch over you. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L05D174
 Stay with Bogdaran from now on. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L05D175
 Good luck! XXX
// Delia perso10
L05D176
 Light go with you, Arkhan. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D177A
 Don't worry, Arkhan, I'll take care of her. XXX
// Bogdaran perso8
L05D177B
 And I owe you one... I won't forget it. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L05D178A
 The more I look at you, the better I understand Bogdaran. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L05D178B
 I hope one day you'll come back here to dance...  just for me. XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L05D179
 Oh... You're quite a dish... XXX
// Delia perso10
L05D180A
 I'm grateful for what you've done, Arkhan. XXX
// Delia (suggesting future favors) perso10
L05D180B
 And if the Sun God is willing, one day I'll prove it to you... XXX
// Bogdaran (upset to see Arkhan hovering around Delia) perso8 
L05D181
 Er, Arkhan, it... isn't it about time you left?... XXX
// Delia (not interested in what Arkhan is showing her) perso10
L05D86
 You know, I... XXX
// Arkhan2 L (has fought with Delia) perso2
L45D01
 Stop, Delia. Cool it! XXX
// Arkhan2 O (has fought with Delia) perso2
L45D02
 Want more of the same, slut?! XXX
// Arkhan3 L (has fought with Delia) perso3
L45D03
 Stop it! XXX
// Arkhan1 G perso1
L05D182
 Nothing useful on these shelves. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D183
 Useless odds and ends... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D184
 Nothing useful up here.... XXX
// Bogdaran (as A. searches his things, sarcastic) perso8
L05D194
 Hey! Make yourself right at home! XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L05D185
 The barrels are empty. XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L05D186
 There's nothing inside! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso1
L05D187
 Empty barrels.  XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L05D188
 Empty! XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L05D190
 Empty! XXX
// Arkhan1G perso1
L05D191
 An old empty trunk. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L05D192
 An old empty trunk. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L05D193
 Nothing inside. XXX
