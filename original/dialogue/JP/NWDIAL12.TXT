 // Bandor perso7
L12D03
 What are you doing here? XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D04
 Why have you come back? XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D05
 We can do nothing more for you. XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D01
 Stand back! You have no right to be here! XXX
// Khorad perso83
L12D02
 Leave now or we'll summon the Guardians of Fire! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D108
 A secret compartment! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso2
L12D109
 A hiding-place! XXX
// Bandor (scared)perso7
L12D128
 No! I beg you! XXX
// Khorad (scared)perso83
L12D129
 Help me! XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D112
 No, No. Don't hurt us! XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D113
 Look, let's be reasonable. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D06A
 Fear not. I do not want to hurt you.  XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D06B
 I'm looking for Bandor, the Master Builder. XXX
// Khorad (over-anxious) perso83
L12D10
 Bandor's not here!  XXX
// Bandor (trying to disguise his fear) perso7
L12D11
 He...he's down in the Darklands, on a new building site. XXX
// Khorad perso83
L12D12
 Yes. We came back, but he stayed down there. XXX
// Arkhan2 O (impatient) perso2
L12D07
 Where is Bandor, the Master Builder? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D13A
 The Great Sunseer personally instructed me to seek your help. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D13B
 She described Bandor from head to toe. One of you has to be him. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D13C
 The Stallite is in peril. We must act fast!  XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D24
 No. The Great Sunseer would never have said such a thing!  XXX
// Khorad (appeasingly) perso83
L12D25
 Or perhaps she made a mistake... XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D26
 In any case Bandor isn't here. XXX
// Khorad perso83
L12D27
 And we don't know where he is! XXX
// Arkhan2 O (impatient) perso2
L12D14A
 Don't get funny with me! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L12D14B
 Lory told me personally about Bandor, and I'm sure one of you two is him! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L12D14C
 There's no time to waste.  Which one of you is Bandor? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D19A
 I told you. I'm not going to hurt you! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D19B
 I have to know if Rylsadhar gave you a special object...a crystal.  XXX
// Arkhan2 O (annoyed) perso2
L12D20A
 You think I'm stupid enough to believe that all Stallite builders have dark skin and only one leg?! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L12D20B
 I've had enough! Which one of you is Bandor? XXX
// Bandor (conciliatory) perso7
L12D22
 I'm sorry. We don't know. XXX
// Khorad (bluffing) perso83
L12D23A
 You'd better leave, the Guardians of Fire will be here soon. XXX
// Khorad perso83
L12D23B
 And they'll really rough you up! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D200
 Listen to me. I need your help. XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D202
 I'm sorry, we don't know anything. XXX
// Khorad perso83
L12D203
 We can't help you! XXX
// Arkhan2 O (annoyed) perso2
L12D201
 I'm going to lose my temper! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D08
 Relax! I'm looking for Bandor! XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L12D09
 Bandor! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D15A
 Lory told me to look for a man with dark skin and a metal leg! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D15B
 Which one of you is Bandor? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D21A
 I'm on your side.  XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D21B
 I'm looking for a crystal given to Bandor by Rylsadhar. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D300
 I need your help! XXX
// Khorad (frightened) perso83
L12D17
 No. Hands off! XXX
// Bandor (frightened) perso7
L12D18A
 Stand back, creature! XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D18B
 If you lay a finger on us, you'll be sorry! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D32
 I've got your wonderful diagram. Now tell me, which one of you is Bandor? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L12D34
 I've got the diagram. Now tell me, which one of you is Bandor?! XXX
// Khorad (bluffing) perso83
L12D33A
 That diagram is useless.  XXX
// Khorad perso83
L12D33B
 And neither of us is Bandor... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D121
 And this? Does this mean anything to you? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L12D122
 What about this? XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D123
 No, sorry. XXX
// Khorad perso83
L12D124
 No. It doesn't ring a bell. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D40
 Hah! I'm on to your little game! XXX
// Bandor perso07
L12D43
 Okay. Now give me the diagram! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L12D42
 Fun's over! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D47A
 Master Builder, I didn't mean you any harm. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D47B
 Shankr Archessence runs cold and fast through my veins. But I am still Arkhan, Guardian of Fire and son of Rylsadhar. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D47C
 I have sworn to avenge the Stallite and save it from peril. XXX
// Bandor (prudent) perso7
L12D50A
 Mere words! How do I know I can trust you? XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D50B
 Prove to me that you are the son of Rylsadhar and then we'll see if I can help you. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L12D48
 There's no time to waste. I'm Arkhan, son of Rylsadhar, and I'm looking for the crystals hidden by my father.  XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D49A
 I am the son of Rylsadhar.  XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D49B
 I'm looking for the crystals he hid. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D51A
 I have no time for games, Bandor.  XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D51B
 Lory sent me. You must believe me! XXX
// Bandor (firmly) perso7
L12D54A
 No. Rylsadhar would never have allowed me to speak with a... a... XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D54B
 ... a creature like you with no token of your good faith. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L12D52A
 This is no time to argue about details! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L12D52B
 If you have the crystal, give it up! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D53
 Trust me! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D55A
 You want to see proof? Look, I have the crystal bow to the key. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D55B
 I need to find the other pieces in order to enter my father's vault.  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D55C
 Lory thinks the vault may contain secrets that can save us. XXX
// Bandor (suddenly determined) perso7
L12D57A
 All right. I am willing to believe you. XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D57B
 Yes, Rylsadhar did give me one of the crystals. I now give it to you. XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D57C
 But beware! If you use it for evil purposes, may you be triply cursed! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D58
 Thank you, Master Bandor. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L12D59A
 Mmm... XXX
// Arkhan2 O (echoing Bandor's sentence) perso2
L12D59B
 And if your suspicions have cost me precious time, you will pay with your life and your soul! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L12D56A
 Proof? Behold! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L12D56B
 I have the crystal bow! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D60
 Thank you. XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L12D61
 (vaguely friendly growl) XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D125
 Is that proof enough for you? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso2
L12D126
 Here's the proof you seek! XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D127
 No. That proves nothing! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D62A
 Who else would my father have given the bow to? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D62B
 Any ideas? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L12D63A
 Besides you, who else did my father give a crystal to? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L12D63B
 Answer me! XXX
// Bandor (thinking quickly) perso7
L12D65
 Euh... The High Priestess Lory, for sure. And of course the great Zed. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D66
 Hmm... who else? XXX
// Bandor (hesitating) perso7
L12D68A
 Well... maybe Rylsadhar had enough time to visit Leona. XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D68B
 She's a strange woman who lives in the Darklands. Few people would trust her... XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D68C
 But your father seemed to be friends with her. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D69
 I've seen Leona. My father didn't give her anything. XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D71
 In that case, I can't think of anyone else... sorry... XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D72
 Where would I find Leona? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L12D73
 This Leona you mentioned, how can I find her? XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D75A
 She lives far from the Stallite, in the Darklands. No one really knows where... XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D75B
 Some say she dwells in hiding near the shore. XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D75C
 But others say you will find her only if she wants you to. XXX
// Khorad perso83
L12D76A
 In any case, it would be crazy to go outside...  XXX
// Khorad perso83
L12D76B
 And don't forget. The streets are blocked off and the Stallite gates are closed! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D77A
 In the name of Rahal, I thought you were the Master Builder! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D77B
 You must know another way out of the Stallite! XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D78
 No. There used to be tunnels, but they caved in and were flooded during the earthquake. XXX
// Khorad perso83
L12D79
 Yes. And that was many cycles ago... XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D81A
 Lory told me about a special underground place, a Tomb. I must reach this place. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D81B
 Do you know anything? XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D84
 "Tomb". No. I've never heard of such a place. XXX
// Khorad perso83
L12D85A
 The Stallite was built very long ago.  XXX
// Khorad perso83
L12D85B
 Even Master Bandor doesn't know all the secrets. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L12D82A
 Lory told me about a Tomb. And you and your builders erected the Stallite. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L12D82B
 So where is this Tomb? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D91A
 I saw the entrance to a bunker in the Darklands. It looked like a door from Before.  XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D91B
 You who know everything about the Stallite, can you tell me how to get in? XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D92
 That place is a mystery, even for me. XXX
// Khorad perso83
L12D93A
 People say that one of the scavengers claimed to have been inside. But Dhorkan had him arrested. XXX
// Khorad perso83
L12D93B
 And since then, no one has ever made the same claim. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L12D94A
 There's a strange door down below, a door from Before. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L12D94B
 I want to go through that door, and you're going to tell me how to do it! XXX
// Khorad perso83
L12D95
 It's condemned. No one can enter. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D86A
 Well, thank you for your help. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L12D86B
 I won't waste any more of your time. Light be with you! XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D87
 Good luck, son of Rylsadhar. XXX
// Khorad perso83
L12D88
 And be careful... XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L12D89A
 All right, let's not waste any more time. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L12D89B
 Out of my way, I'm in a hurry! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D64A
 Where can I find the other crystals? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D64B
 Do you know? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D67
 Hmm... who else? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D70
 I saw Leona. No luck. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D74
 Where can I find Leona? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D80
 There must be another way... XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D83
 I'm looking for a special place, a Tomb. Where is it? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D96A
 In the Darklands there's a door. It must belong to a building from Before. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D96B
 I must get inside. Can you help me? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L12D90
 Thank you. Light be with you. XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D105A
 You're crazy! Stop! XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D105B
 We can do no more for you, let us be! XXX
// Bandor (forced to fight) perso7
L12D107
 Khorad, get him! XXX
// Khorad perso83
L12D41
 Give that diagram back to Master Bandor, and do it NOW! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D110
 There's nothing in his pockets! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L12D111
 O evil blood! Nothing! XXX
// Khorad perso83
L12D30
 Don't touch that diagram. It's a very valuable document! XXX
// Bandor perso7
L12D31
 It belongs to the Master Builder! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D28
 There's nothing left to take! XXX
// Arkhan3 perso3
L12D29
 Nothing more here. XXX
// Arkhan2 G (turning his head towards Bandor & Khorad) perso2
L12D35A
 If neither of you is Bandor...  XXX
// Arkhan2 G (turning his head towards Bandor & Khorad) perso2
L12D35B
 You won't mind if I set fire to his wonderful diagram! XXX
// Bandor (panicked) perso7
L12D38
 NO! XXX
// Bandor (moving towards Arkhan) perso7
L12D39
 All right ... Yes. I am Bandor. Give me back the diagram. XXX
// Arkhan2 Gperso2
L14D45
 About time! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L12D36
 This is your last chance. Which of you is Bandor? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L12D37
 Or I torch the diagram! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L14D46
 Bandor, at last! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D45
 If I know which one is Bandor, I won't burn the diagram! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L12D46
 If I can deal with Bandor, I won't burn the diagram! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D103
 Nothing useful on the desk... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L12D104
 Nothing on the desk... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D97
 Nothing on the desk! XXX
// Arkhan3 perso3
L12D98
 Nothing here! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D99
 Nothing on the lectern. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D101
 One of those relics from Before. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L12D102
 A relic from Before. XXX
// Khorad (whispering) perso83
L12D119
 He touched the snake! XXX
// Bandor (whispering) perso7
L12D120
 Don't worry. Let him do what he wants. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L12D117
 I've already pulled the lever. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L12D118
 I've already pulled the lever. XXX
