 The shooting range. Nothing here. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L07D43
 The shooting range is empty. XXX

L16D305
 I see... But you won't have any luck here. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L16D311A
 I was wondering-do you ever smile? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L16D311B
 Or do you spend all your time trying to look tough? XXX
// Maor perso17
L16D312A
 I only smile at pretty girls, okay? XXX
