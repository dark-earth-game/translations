 Have to be pretty brave to sleep up there. XXX

L39D111
 Sleep up there... Have to be brave... XXX
// Leona (imperiously) perso14
L39D01A
 Who are you? XXX
// Leona (imperiously) perso14
L39D01B
 What are you doing in my domain? XXX
// Leona (angry) perso14
L39D107
 How dare you return?! XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D03A
 Arkhan. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D03B
 What do you want from me? XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D02
 You again? XXX
// Leona (warily) perso14
L39D04
 Be still! You have nothing to fear from me. XXX
// Leona (attacked by A.) perso14
L39D108
 You have become a slave to the darkness! XXX
// Leona (relaxing) perso14
L39D05
 That's better. Be calm, and we can talk. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D06A
 I'm Arkhan, son of Rylsadhar.  XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D06B
 I come in peace.  XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D07A
 I'm Arkhan, son of Rylsadhar.  XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D07B
 Are you Leona the sorceress? XXX
// Leona (on the defensive) perso14
L39D08A
 Arkhan, you say. I know your father. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D08B
 But I've never seen you before. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D08C
 How do I know you're telling the truth? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D09A
 Proof?  XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D09B
 I can offer you nothing but my word! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D10A
 Nothing. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D10B
 But for the sake of our survival, you better believe me! XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D11A
 That's not much... XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D11B
 But your words are not tarnished by lies. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D11C
 I sense that I can trust you. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D18A
 The situation is serious.  XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D18B
 The Stallite's been swallowed by Darkness. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D19A
Hey lady,  In case you hadn't noticed, everyone's gone crazy out there! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D19B
 The Stallite's been swallowed by Darkness. XXX
// Leona (alarmed) perso14
L39D20A
 The Well of Sacred Light! XXX
// Leona (alarmed) perso14
L39D20B
 Who could have done such a thing? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D21A
 You seem to know a lot. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D21B
 A renegade Sunseer by the name of Thanandar. XXX
// Leona (stupefied) perso14
L39D22
 Thanandar the healer?! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D23A
 He once was a healer...  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D23B
 Now, he's not even human. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D23C
 He was responsible for the deaths of Zed and my father! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D24
 Thanandar infected my father, the same way he infected me. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D25
 Thanandar infected Zed, the same way he infected me. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D26A
 He wasn't himself any more... maddened with pain... blinded... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D26B
 Thanandar forced him to touch the Well of Sacred Light. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D26C
 There were flashes of lightning and the Well of Light stopped shining, as if it were being filled with that black stuff. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D26D
 Soon after that, the Black Shroud engulfed the Stallite. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D33A
 I'm looking for a place. The Great Sunseer calls it the Tomb. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D33B
 A secret place my father's been seeking for many years. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D34A
 I must find his notes. They're hidden in some secret place. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D34B
 I need a crystal key made of different pieces. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D35A
 Lory told me about a place, the "Tomb". XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D35B
 It's our last hope, but my father is the only one who knows how to get there... maybe! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D36A
 I gotta have a key to get into the place where his notes are hidden. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D36B
 A key, a key.. A crystal key, made of different pieces! XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D37A
 You're right. The time to act has come. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D37B
 Lory is a wise woman. I know she would never have revealed these things if it weren't vital. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D37C
 I will help you Arkhan.  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D40A
 My father didn't come to see you recently, did he? XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D41A
 No, I haven't seen Rylsadhar for many, many moons. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D41B
 I know he was worried. I think he sensed the coming of these dark events. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D41C
 Your father was an Initiate, one of the few people who knew about the crypt in the Well of Light. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D41D
 Also one of the few with the power to touch the Well of Light. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D41E
 That is why Thanandar captured him! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D43A
 None of this means anything to me. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D43B
 What is this "Well of Light"? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D44A
 I'm sick of all these mysteries! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D44B
 Somebody tell me what's really going on?! XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D45A
 As you have guessed, the Well of Light and the... Tomb... are connected. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D45B
 The Well of Light was a gift. It draws on the force in the Tomb to protect us from the Darkness. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D45C
 This force, invisible to human eyes, runs through the land around the Stallite. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D45D
 It protects us from the Dark Shroud and its minions. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D45E
 It attracts the rays of the Sun God that give us strength and weaken our enemies. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D45F
 But without the Well of Light, we are condemned to Darkness. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D46A
 Why didn't anyone else  know about these places of light? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D46B
 And what do Zed, Lory, and my father have to do with it? XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D47A
 Zed, Rylsadhar, and the Great Sunseer-like me and some others-were bound by a... a pact. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D47B
 A pact the origins of which date from the dawn of time, long before the Great Cataclysm. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D47C
 A pact concluded between the ancestors of our ancestors' ancestors and They that slumber in the Tomb. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D47D
 We swore to protect the Well of Light and the Tomb by keeping them secret until the awakening of those slumbering deep within the earth. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D47E
 In exchange, some of our ancestors themselves were granted a little of this force. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D47F
 A life force they could draw from the Well of Light, and return to it, as they wished. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D47G
 A force enabling them to do things ordinary humans cannot do. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D47H
 This life force traveled down the ages and persisted in Zed, Rylsadhar, and Lory-the Initiates. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D48
 The force Zed passed on to me before he was transformed! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D49
 The force Zed passed on to me before he died! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D50
 That's what it was! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D55A
 If the force of light exists... XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D55B
 Then the evil-the poison Thanandar contaminated us with... that's the opposing force! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D56A
 And that lousy stuff Thanandar poisoned us with? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D56B
 It's the opposite of the force of Light, is that it? XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D57A
 Yes. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D57B
 This Dark poison feeds off the energy of living beings. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D57C
 Those who don't die are transformed... like you. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D57D
 Little by little, they forget who and what they are. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D57E
 They become bloodthirsty creatures, insatiable, ravening. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D58
 But the force in the Tomb can vanquish the poison, can't it? XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D59A
 Yes, the two forces consume each other. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D59B
 But if the poison has penetrated too deeply inside you, the shock to your system would be terrible... XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D59C
 And then you, too, would perish! XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D60
 That's what happened to Rylsadhar when he touched the Well of Light. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D61
 That's what happened to Zed when he touched the Well of Light. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D64A
 And Thanandar?  XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D64B
 What's he looking for? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D65A
 And that double-crossing Thanandar? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D65B
 What does he want?! XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D66A
 Thanandar was an Initiate, like us. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D66B
 As a healer, he was fascinated by the force of Darkness. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D66C
 He wanted to understand it, to find a cure. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D66D
 I don't know what impelled him to betray the cause, to commit these acts of madness. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D66E
 Perhaps he was contaminated accidentally... XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D66F
 If the poison is within him, his mind and soul may have suffered the most horrible of transformations. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D66G
 One thing is certain: if he is not stopped, he will lead us to our doom! XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D66H
 Do you know where he is now? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D67A
 No. But I have an idea he's still in the Stallite, with other Creatures... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D67B
 I'm sure he'll stay till the bitter end! XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D68
 You must stop him, destroy him. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D69A
 I've already tried. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D69B
 The Dark evil has made him too strong. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D69C
I...I don't think I can beat him. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D70A
 Easy! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D70B
Hey, It's obvious you've never been up against him! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D70C
 If you're so tough, you go after him?! XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D71A
 Then there's only one solution: find the Tomb and bring the Light back to the Stallite! XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D71B
 Before Thanandar and his monsters complete their evil deed! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D75A
 You look like someone who knows many things. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D75B
 Do you know how to get into the Tomb? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D76
 Since you're so smart, you can tell me how to get into the Tomb, right? XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D77A
 No. The secret was lost in the Great Cataclysm. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D77B
 The Tomb is buried deep beneath the Stallite. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D77C
 And the ancients say the path to it is long and dangerous. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D77D
 Even if you find the hidden entrance, many ordeals remain before you can enter into the heart of the Tomb. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D78
 What ordeals? XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D79A
 I do not know. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D79B
 Perhaps Rylsadhar discovered something, but he never told me about it. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D82
 Can you do something to put out the fire of this poison consuming me? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D83
 What do you say we talk about healing me? XXX
// Leona (suddenly recalling that Arkhan is suffering) perso14
L39D84A
 Yes, of course! XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D84B
 I can't cure you completely of the evil that has you in its grip. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D84C
 But the force of Life and Light is here in this place. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D84D
 That is why nature flourishes here. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D84E
 That stone colossus standing in the center of the grotto... XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D84F
 The force from the Well of Light passed through it. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D84G
 If you drink the water surrounding it, it will purify you. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D84H
 But drink only a little, for the poison is intermingled with the living tissues of your body. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D84I
 Your very life will be at risk! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D86A
 Thank you Leona. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L39D86B
 I hope I'll make it! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D87A
It's been nice but I'm out of here! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D87B
 I've got some lives to save... XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L39D87C
 Especially my own! XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D88
 Good luck Arkhan. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D89
 Be careful. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D90
 I know you can do it, son of Rylsadhar! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D95
 You recognize this? XXX
// Leona (wary) perso14
L39D96
 First, tell me who you are and what you want. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D97
 Here's a piece of my father's key. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D98
 Sorry, but I don't have anything like that. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D99
 What's this? XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D100
 A piece of rock crystal. XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D101
 It's uncut. I don't think it's what you're looking for. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L39D102
 What can you tell me about it? XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D103
 Nothing special, sorry. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D12
 I'm looking for Leona. XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L39D13
 Leona? XXX
// Leona (alarmed) perso14
L39D014A
 Great Solaar, it's the Dark Evil incarnate! XXX
// Leona (prudent) perso14
L39D014B
 You are being consumed by the Shankr Archessence. XXX
// Leona (wary) perso14
L39D014C
 Who are you? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D15
 I'm Arkhan, son of Rylsadhar. XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L39D16
 Arkhan! XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D17A
 Son of Rylsadhar! XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D17B
 But what's happening in the Stallite? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D27
 The Stallite... has.. has been swallowed by the Shroud. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D28A
 Yes, the Well of Light. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D28B
 It's Thanandar, a Sunseer. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D28C
 It's all his fault. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D29A
 No, no, no! Not a healer any more! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D29B
 Not even human! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D29C
 He condemned Zed and my father to death! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D30
 Thanandar infected my father, and he infected me. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D31
 Thanandar infected Zed, as he infected me. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D32A
 He was wracked... by pain... XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D32B
 Thanandar made him touch the light. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D32C
 There was lightning... The Well of Light grew dark... XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D32D
 As if it was absorbing the Dark force... XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D32E
And then the Shroud descended. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D38A
 Lory told me about a place, the "Tomb". XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D38B
 Our last chance... XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D38C
 My father may have known where it is. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D39A
 But he hid his secrets well. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D39B
 I'm looking for a crystal key in several pieces. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D42A
 Did my father give you a crystal? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D109
 The Well of Light... The Tomb... Explain them to me. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D51A
 Why all the secrecy? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D51B
 And why Zed, my father, and Lory? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D52
 Zed transmitted a force to me before he died! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D53
 Zed passed his force on to me before the Evil took over. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D54
 That's what it was! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D62A
 The force of Darkness... XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D62B
 It's the opposite of this? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D63
 The force in the Tomb will destroy the poison! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D72
 And Thanandar?  XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D73A
 He's still in the Stallite, with the other Creatures. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D73B
 I'm sure he'll stay till his awful deed is done! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D74A
 Already tried. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D74B
 The Evil has transformed him, he's too strong. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D80A
 You know a lot. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D80B
 Do you know how I can find the Tomb? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D81
 What ordeals? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D85
 Can you help me cure the disease? XXX
// Arkhan3 O (as if getting ready to devour Leona) perso3
L39D92
 Leonaaaa... XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D93
 Arkhan! No, don't let the Darkness overcome you! XXX
// Leona perso14
L39D94
 No! Arkhan, control yourself! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L39D104
 Ever seen this? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D105
 It's a piece of my father's key. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L39D106
 What is it? XXX
