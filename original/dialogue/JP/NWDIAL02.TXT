 Ian. It's me, Arkhan. XXX

L02D86
 I said let me through! XXX

 You better move aside. XXX
// Guardian19 perso59
L02D88
 Arkhan! It's you ? What's happened to you?! XXX
// Arkhan2 G (bitter) perso2
L02D89A
 Just a little gift from the creatures who tried to kill the Great Sunseer! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L02D89B
 And if I don't find an antidote for this poison, it's going to kill me! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L02D90A
 The people who attacked Lory poisoned me.  XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L02D90B
 Without an antidote... I die! XXX
// Guardian19 perso59
L02D91A
 I believe you, Arkhan.  XXX

 No matter what anyone says, I still have faith in you.  XXX

 If you want inside, go ahead... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L02D92
 Thanks, Ian! Thanks a lot! XXX

L02D72
 You... You're going back to the Darklands? What's going on? XXX
// Zed (reassuring) perso84
L02D73A
Don't worry, Guardian of Fire, the walls of our Stallite will protect us. XXX
// Zed perso84
L02D73B
 And if I venture outside these sacred walls, I only do it to keep the Stallite safe.  XXX
// Zed perso84
L02D73C
 It's my duty.  XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L02D74
 I know, my friend, but I worry about you every time you leave.  XXX
// Zed perso84
L02D75
 Don't worry about me, Arkhan, the Sun God watches over me! XXX
// Arkhan1 O (worried) perso1
L02D76
 You're going to the Darklands! You'll never get back alive!  XXX

L02D12
 Okay, go on in! XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L02D13
 Let me through! XXX
// Guardian17 perso57
L02D14
 You need to see the chief? XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L02D15
 None of your business, get outta my way! XXX
// Guardian17 (ruffled) perso57
L02D16
 You'd better change your tune, Guardian of Fire.  Then we'll see what we can do. XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L02D19
 Blasted gloom! Out of my way! XXX
// Guardian17 (angry) perso57

 You lookin' for a fight, huh? Well, be my guest! XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L02D17
 Another lousy day on guard duty! XXX
// Guardian17 perso57
L02D18
 Be quiet! If Dhorkan hears you, he'll throw you in the stockade! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L02D21
 Listen, Muldar. I need to talk to Dhorkan.  XXX

L02D25
 (growls impatiently) It's a matter of life and death! XXX
// Guardian17 perso57
L02D26
 No. If I disobey orders I'll get it in the neck! XXX
// Guardian17 perso57
L02D27
 Not a chance. You're not going in, not with that weapon in your hand. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L02D28
 Let me through! I swear by the Sun God I won't try anything! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L02D29
 I just wanna talk to Dhorkan I swear it! XXX
// Guardian17 perso57
L02D30
 Out of respect for the man you used to be, I'd like to believe you.  XXX
// Guardian17 perso57
L02D31
 I'd like to believe you... but put that weapon away! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L02D32
 Muldar, I'm begging you... XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L02D33
 Muldar, let me through! XXX
// Guardian17 perso57
L02D35A
 How many times do I have to repeat myself! XXX
// Guardian17 perso57
L02D35B
 You can't go in to see the Provost with a weapon in your hand! XXX

L02D37
Move it! XXX
// Guardian17 perso57
L02D38
 No way! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L02D39
 Get the hell outta my way, or I'll blow your brains all over this door! XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L02D40
 (growls a challenge) XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L02D42
 I'll be back... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L02D43
 I'll be back... XXX
// Arkhan1 G perso1
L02D44
 Calm down! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L02D45
 Stop! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L02D46
 Enough! XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso0

 (growls) XXX

L01D177
 (growls) XXX

 (growls) XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L02D47
 We're almost there.. XXX

L02D49
 Good! XXX
// Delia (Arkhan shows her an object) perso10

// Delia (hit by Arkhan) perso10
L45D04
 What's gotten into you?!? XXX
// Kalhi (afraid) perso33
L04D41
 Arkhan! What's come over you? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L04D51A
 But what were you doing in prison? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L04D52A
 Who sent you to the stockade? XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L04D53A
 The Guardians of Fire, they captured me in Rylsadhar's room.  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L04D51B
 And they let you keep your knife? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L04D51C
 Wonderful guards we have! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L04D52B
But  they didn't take away your knife?! Good work! XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L04D53B
 They said Rylsadhar had disappeared, and then  they suspected me of having something to do with it. XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L04D53C
 I tried to explain, but they locked me up without even listening. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L04D54
 What does all this mean? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L04D55
 What does all this mean?  XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L04D56A
 I don't have the slightest idea...  XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L04D56B
 I'm afraid something bad has happened to Rylsadhar! XXX
// Arkhan2 O (aggressive) perso2
L04D57
 How did they manage to catch you? XXX
// Arkhan3 O (aggressive) perso3
L04D58
 Stupid to get caught! XXX
// Kalhi (irritated) perso13
L04D59
 What was I supposed to do? Put up a fight, and let them kill me? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L04D63A
 Well, with a face like mine, it's kind of hard to blend in with the crowd. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L04D63B
 And your Scavenger clothes... they stand out all right. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L04D64A
 A creature from the Darklands and a Scavenger... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L04D64B
We stand out just a little! XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L02D108
 If only you hadn't torn the guard's uniform in prison.... XXX
// Arkhan2 G (somber) perso2
L02D101A
 Not too many people here...  it's down below we'll have a problem. XXX
// Arkhan3G (somber) perso3
L02D101B
 Everything's quiet here... The problems will start down below. XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L02D102
 That's for sure! They're not going to let us just stroll out the door. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L02D114A
 Look, I picked this up at Bogdaran's place. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L02D114B
 An old uniform from the days when he was still thin! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L02D115
 Here, put this on! XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L02D116
 I hope it'll fit. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L08D336
 Look at this! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L08D337
 Look! XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L08D338
 There's no time, Arkhan, we've got to get out of here! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L08D333
 Everything that's happened is your fault! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L08D334
 It's all your fault! XXX
// Kalhi (forced to defend herself) perso33
L04D43
 Arkhan, no! XXX
// Kalhi (frightened) perso33
L04D42
 No, Arkhan! You have to resist! XXX
// Arkhan2 G (amused by Kalhi in uniform) perso2
L04D28A
 You in that uniform! What a sight! XXX
// Arkhan2 G (amused by Kalhi in uniform) perso2
L04D28B
 If Phedoria doesn't like it, she knows what she can do with it! XXX
// Arkhan3 G (amused by Kalhi in uniform) perso3
L04D29
 A real.. guardian! XXX
// Kalhi perso33
L04D30
 Stop making fun of me! Let's go! XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L08D341
 You don't leave me any choice! XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L08D339
 Hey, look out! XXX
// Kalhi perso13
L08D340
 No, stop! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L02D200
 Phedoria, I have good reason to believe Dhorkan is a traitor! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L02D201
 Phedoria, I think Dhorkan is a traitor. XXX
// Phedoria perso26
L02D202
 What? You'd better have solid proof before you make such a serious accusation! XXX
// Phedoria perso26
L02D203A
 You can't respect the law if you don't respect its representatives.  XXX
// Phedoria perso26
L02D203B
 So... no more dark suspicions.  Do you understand me?  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L02D204
 But Phedoria... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L02D205
 But Phedoria... XXX
// Phedoria perso26
L02D206
 Have I made myself clear?  One act of defiance doesn't prove anything!  XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L02D207
 All right, you'll get your proof... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L02D208
 All right, you'll get your proof.. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L02D209
 Look, here's the proof that Dhorkan's a traitor! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L02D210
 Read this! Dhorkan betrayed us! XXX
// Phedoria perso26
L02D211
 Holy Sun God! You were right, Arkhan! Hurry, we have to stop him! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L02D212
 Do you know what it is? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L02D213
This, do  you know what this is? XXX
// Phedoria perso26
L02D214
 That's enough, get of my light! XXX
// Phedoria (Arkhan hit her) perso26
L02D215
 Try that again, and you'll be sorry!  XXX
// Phedoria perso26
L02D216
 I warned you, you dirty traitor! XXX
// Arkhan1 G perso2
L02D298
 Old abandoned barrels... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L02D300
 Old abandoned barrels.... XXX

L02D301
 Old barrels... XXX

L02D299
 Huh! Nothing but old barrels... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L02D302
 Just a pile of old barrels... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L02D303
  A pile of old barrels... XXX
// Arkhan1 G perso1
L02D308
 It's the old guard room, the entrance has been closed off. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L02D309
 The old guard room. It's locked up. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L02D310
 The door's sealed... XXX
// Arkhan1 G perso1
L02D311
 No, it's stuck. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L02D312
 It's no use, it's stuck! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L02D313
 It's stuck! XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L02D111A
 An old combat-training dummy. XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L02D111B
I learned a lot from this old guy! XXX
// Arkhan1 L perso1
L02D111C
 That thing is jammed and rusted-out, but the Builders have constructed a new one up above.  XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
L07D34A
 One of those useless combat dummies. XXX
// Arkhan1 O perso1
