 // Archivist (fearful) perso5
L28D100
 Who's there? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D101
 Arkhan. You remember me? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L28D102
 Arkhan! XXX
// Archivist (reassured) perso5
L28D103A
 Ah, it's you, Arkhan. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D103B
 Come closer, closer! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D01
 Don't be afraid, old man! XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D02
 Me? Afraid? Afraid of whom, young man? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D03A
 Uh... of me... XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D03B
 What I mean is, maybe I startled you... XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D04A
 Do not be concerned about that, my young friend. It would take a lot more than you to frighten old Sesekhan. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D04B
 You know, I've seen many strange things in my time as Archivist... XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L28D05
 Don't be afraid, ancient one! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L28D06
 You want to know? Me, of course! The way I look, everyone runs away screaming! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L28D07
 Don't be afraid! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L28D08
 Uh... I... nothing... nothing. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D09
 So. What brings you see the Archivist, young man? Old Sesekhan doesn't get many visitors... XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D11A
 Eh?... Oh, a visitor... Forgive me... at my age, you know... XXX
// Archivist	perso5
L28D11B
 I was absorbed in my work, I didn't hear you come in... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D84
 It's opening! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L28D120
 It's opening! XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D22A
 Sorry, my young friend, I am a little hard of hearing. I do not quite understand. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D22B
 Can you speak up? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D72A
 Light be with you, Archivist. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D72B
 I'm Arkhan, son of Sunseer Rylsadhar. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D73A
 You are the son of Rylsadhar? XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D73B
 Forgive me, but I am as blind as a Temple bat. I did not recognize you. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D73C
 And it has been many, many moons since you last came here. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D73D
 You were just a wee scamp the last time... It's a pleasure to see you all grown up... XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D74
 Uh... yeah, me too... XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L28D75
 So you're the Archivist? My name is Arkhan... XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D76A
 Welcome to the Archive Room, Arkhan... XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D76B
 If you're looking for the guiding lights of knowledge, I'll do my best to help you. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L28D77
 I'm Arkhan XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D26
 I'm looking for information about a crypt... XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D27A
 A crypt... Maybe you should go see Bandor the Master Builder. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D27B
 No one knows the Stallite from top to bottom better than he does. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D28
 The Master Builder... And where would I find him? XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D29A
 In the Builders' Palace, next-door to the Great Temple. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D29B
 But I don't know if he will be there. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D29C
 He often goes down to the Lower City to supervise his work sites. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L28D30
 What do you know about a crypt located near here? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L28D31
Oh yeah? And where would I find this "Bandor"? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L28D32
 Archivist, I must find a secret crypt! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L28D33
 Where is it? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D34
 Archivist, you're wise. Do you know what weird disease has infected me? XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D35A
 The Black Rot. Yes, I have heard of it. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D35B
 I am not a healer-Sunseer like Thanandar, but I know this is a dreadful illness. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D35C
 Who do you say is sick? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D36A
 Uh... a friend of mine. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D36B
 Do you know of a cure? XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D37A
 Alas, no. The healers have been seeking a cure for centuries. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D37B
 But no one has ever really been able to cure the Black Rot. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D38
 I'll find a cure! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L28D39
 I've got to find a cure for this dark sickness infecting me! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L28D40
 I am sick, you smelly old fart! You must know of a remedy! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L28D41
 Thank you, you've been helpful! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L28D42
 I'm looking for a cure for  this disease! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L28D43
 Do you know a cure? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L28D44
 Blast it! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D45
 You don't know anything else that... that might help me? XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D46
 Sorry, my young friend, I don't know what else to tell you... XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L28D47
 Boiling Blood! You could at least try to help me! XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D48A
 You are young and hot-blooded. Try relaxing, it will do you a world of good. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D48B
 If I can help you, I will, believe me. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D48C
 If you want, I can look in my archives for information on the Black Rot. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D48D
 Come back later and I will tell you if I found anything. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L28D49
 Hmm. Okay! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L28D62
 Sure you didn't find anything else? XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D61
 No, my young friend. That's all. I'm sorry. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D52
 So, Archivist, have you found out more about this disease from the dark? XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D53A
 Ahem, as you well know... XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D53B
 Our archives could not possibly contain all the knowledge acquired by mankind under the light of the Sun God. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D53C
 However, I did find some writings about this sickness. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D53D
 No mention of a remedy, but the phrase "Lightstone" crops up often. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D54
 What kind of stone is that? XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D55A
 I do not know, but one of the writers has said this: XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D55B
 "If the stricken one is rapidly put into contact with the Lightstone, the sickness can be eradicated". XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D55C
 "But if the stricken one is treated too late, if the roots of the sickness run too deep, the victim may die... or worse". XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D55D
 That's all I could find. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D56A
 It's better than nothing. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D56B
 Thanks for your help, Sesekhan. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L28D50
 Archivist, this is an emergency, I must have a cure! XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D51A
 It's that bad then... Yes, yes, I see, I understand... XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D51B
 Hark, I will see what I can find in my Archives about this illness. XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L28D63
 No more to tell me? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L28D57
 Anything about this sickness from the dark? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L28D58
 Anything else? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L28D59
 No, not me! Never! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D12
 I'm supposed to meet my father, Rylsadhar. Have you seen him? XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D13A
 Ah, your father is a fine man. He often comes to see me. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D13B
 He is obsessed with the mysteries of Before. He does a lot of research. He is very learned. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D13C
 Not like Sunseer Broguel. I pity his pea-sized brain... so tiny, banging around in that empty skull of his...! You know, one day, he... XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D14
 Okay, okay. that's enough. Have you seen my father or not? XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D15A
 Eh? Your father? Uh... Why, no, I haven't seen him since the Sun God rose today. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D15B
 Maybe he's praying in the Rahal Room, could that not be so?... XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L28D16
 I'm looking for Rylsadhar. Seen him? XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D17A
 Rylsadhar? No, my young friend, I am alone here with my scrolls. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D17B
 But maybe I can help you look through the writings of our ancestors, more recent writings, or holy manuscripts... XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L28D18
 Hold it! I couldn't care less about that! I want to see my father Rylsadhar! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L28D19
 Have you seen Rylsadhar? XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L28D20
 No. I'm waiting for Rylsadhar! XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D21A
 I regret to say he is not here. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D21B
 Maybe he is praying in the Rahal Room... XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D23A
 Sesekhan, are you sure Rylsadhar hasn't been by? XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D23B
 He was supposed to wait for me here. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D24A
 I am sure! My poor eyes are no longer very keen, but I assure you, son of Rylsadhar, no one has come by... XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D24B
 Apart from you, of course, which is already quite an event! XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L28D25
 Think, old man! Are you sure that Rylsadhar hasn't been by here? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D64
 Do you know what this is? XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D65A
 That is what Rylsadhar called "the key to the music of the spheres". XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D65B
 Although I have never heard music of that kind in the Temple. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D65C
 In fact, the great trumpets have been silent for a long time now. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D65D
 Before, there were many keys to music like this one. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D65E
 But the others disappeared some time ago. Stolen, certain people claim... XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D65F
 Only Rylsadhar's remained, and so he entrusted it to safekeeping here. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L28D66
 What is it? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D217
 You ever seen this document? XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D218A
 Hm... some drawings... a short poem... XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D218B
 The handwriting is that of Rylsadhar. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D218C
 I'd know it anywhere. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D113
 What is this disk? XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D114A
 Magnificent, isn't it? XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D114B
 It's a relic from Before, from that glorious era when our world basked in radiant light. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D114C
 Keep it, I hope it will bring you good luck. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D67
 What can you tell me about it? XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D68
 What? Hmm... I really could not say... I am very sorry... XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D104
 What's going on?! XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D105A
 I am troubled, son of Rylsadhar. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D105B
 I heard screams and horrible noises next door. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D105C
 And something... something enormous, yes, went past my door. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D105D
 I am old and my ears play tricks on me, but I am sure something horrible has happened. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D107A
 Don't worry, I'll take care of it. XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D107B
 As for you, stay here and hide, it'll be safer. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L28D110
 What's got you all wound up? XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L28D111
 Okay, calm down! I'll take care of it! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D108
 Tell me what you heard. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L28D112
 That's all? XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D109A
 Screams, women screaming. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D109B
 And a kind of voice... it was inhuman... evil. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D109C
 And then nothing, silence. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso2
L28D115
 What's wrong with you! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso2
L28D107
 Stay here. I'll go check it out. XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso2
L28D116A
 What did you hear? XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso2
L28D116B
 Talk! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D118A
 Sesekhan, our enemies are here. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D118B
 The Great Sunseer Lory has been assassinated! XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D119A
 Lory, dead? XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D119B
 Great Solaar, preserve us! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D121
 Stay here, hide, and don't make any noise. XXX
// Archivist perso5
L28D122
 Very well. Be careful, my young friend! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L28D123A
 Our enemies are here! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L28D123B
 Lory is dead! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L28D124
 Stay here. Hide! XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D71A
 The History of our Stallite by Sunseer Gabka: XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D71B
 The organization of our Stallite, Sparta, dates from the time of Thelen Khron. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D71C
 This came after construction of the Temple to the Sun God and the Great Square. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D71D
 The Sunseers, initiated by the light of wisdom and messengers from the Sun God, welcomed into their newly-built city all of the Just who sought refuge there. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D71E
 The Guardians of Fire, loyal servants of the Sun God, helped the Sunseers welcome, lodge, and protect the new arrivals. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D71F
 The structures, from the finest to the most humble, were erected by the Builders. It was the famous Turkhan who planned the most resplendent of Sparta's spaces. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D71G
 Men and women skilled in farming and hunting joined together to form the Providers. XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D71H
 And the many Scavengers -- old and young, men and women -- helped everyone make Sparta a haven of peace and light amid the Darkness... XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D71I
 Hmmm... Things aren't what they used to be, are they?! XXX

 That's old stuff! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D82
 There's a mechanism, but I can't get it to work. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L28D83
 Piece of crap! XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L28D97
 What's this mechanism? XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L28D99
 There's nothing left!! XXX
// Arkhan2 L perso2
L28D88
 There's something here. XXX
// Arkhan2 O perso2
L28D87
 What's this gizmo?! XXX
// Arkhan3 L perso3
L28D90
 Some kind of gizmo here! XXX
// Arkhan3 O perso3
L28D92
 What's this thing? XXX
// Arkhan2 G perso2
L28D69
 Hmm... The writing's illegible... XXX
// Arkhan3 G perso3
L28D70
 (grunting)... illegible... XXX
