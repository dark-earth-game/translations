# Dark Earth Portuguese Translation

Early work in progress. The translation is not complete and may contain errors.

## Instructions

Copy the contents of the portuguese folder into the root folder of the game. The files will be copied to the `data` folder.

The game uses the British English localisation code GB that is not used by any other localisation. You just neede to make sure, the Dialog folder only contains the GB.CHK file. If you have any other file like US.CHK just rename it to something else.
